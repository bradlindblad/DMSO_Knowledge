Story at a Glance:

•Chronic respiratory diseases, while quite profitable, remain an area that medicine struggles with, and as such many with them are subjected to a life of healthcare expenses, impaired stamina, and in many cases, a painful decline until they succumb to the illness.

•DMSO is an “umbrella remedy” capable of treating a wide range of challenging ailments due to its combination of therapeutic properties (e.g., reducing inflammation, improving circulation, and reviving dying cells).

•Many of these properties (e.g., reducing fibrosis and inflammation, restoring damaged organs, improving circulation) are uniquely suited to address the underlying causes of chronic respiratory diseases.

•DMSO is also quite useful for addressing the infections that frequently accompany these disorders, as it has antimicrobial activity, reduces damaging lung inflammation, and potentiates many antimicrobial therapies (e.g., many untreatable resistant respiratory infections rapidly respond to DMSO mixed with an antibiotic and many individuals have cured a chronic illness by combining DMSO with a natural antimicrobial).

•A large volume of published data and many user reports show that DMSO often produces remarkable results for a wide range of respiratory disorders, of which asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia) will be covered here.

• This article will review the data demonstrating DMSO’s efficacy for lung diseases, along with an examination of the most common protocols used for them and other natural approaches that also aid in their treatment (e.g., for asthma, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis). It will also provide guidelines for general DMSO procurement and use.

Since childhood, I have known numerous smokers who had slow agonizing deaths from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which were often quite traumatic for their family and friends, particularly as they became increasingly disabled from their loss of respiratory function.

Once I entered medicine, I saw the other half of this and lost count of how many COPD patients were subjected to the same medical protocols (which they often could not refuse as people will do anything to be able to not suffocate), and then be hospitalized either for a COPD exacerbation or pneumonia (a common COPD complication) making them unable to breathe, and before long enter a cycle of ever more frequent repeat hospitalizations until they die.
Note: steroids are frequently used to manage COPD and slow the destruction of the lungs. Steroids have a variety of side effects, including suppressing the immune system, which coupled with the reduced respiratory turnover seen in COPD (which reduces their ability to clear bacteria from the airway), makes them much more vulnerable to pneumonia.

As such, when I later learned that the lungs concentrate a coating of glutathione (at levels 100 times that in other parts of the body) to protect them from damage, and that restoring this coating with nebulized glutathione could (without side effects) prevent further progression of COPD, I was overjoyed (e.g., see this study and this study or the even more dramatic results when used for a COPD exacerbation).
Note: in chronic lung diseases, the lung’s glutathione tends to be depleted.

Unfortunately, this idea never caught on, and most of my conventional colleagues were not open to it (although I’ve come across many integrative doctors and naturopaths over the years who offer it for both COPD and chronic damage from wildfire inhalation).

To some extent, this is to be expected, as, like many businesses, medicine revolves around recurring sales, and COPD is one of its core markets (as COPD patients are on medications for life and often need more of them as the disease progresses). This in turn, helps to explain why chronic diseases of the respiratory tract are the fourth most common cause of death in the United States, and in the United States alone, 24 billion dollars was spent on COPD in 2023. In short, this is not a market that the medical industry will ever willingly relinquish, regardless of the suffering that is created.

Note: pneumonia and COPD are two of the most common reasons for hospital admissions. Asthma is in a similar situation, as while not fatal or anywhere as likely to send one to the hospital (admissions for asthma exacerbations are around 0.7% of hospital admissions), it requires the chronic consumption of similar medications, makes over 40 billion a year (and increasing at 4.4% annually), is a frequent source of hospital admissions (for asthma exacerbations), and despite all the money that’s been poured into it, asthma rates keep going up (e.g., in 1999 9.1% of Americans had ever been diagnosed with asthma whereas in 2022 44.2 million Americans had).

## Umbrella Remedies
In medicine, there are a few therapies (e.g., ultraviolet blood irradiation) that have the ability to cure a wide range of diseases, and as such are referred to as “umbrella therapies.” This is because, amongst other things, they address the root causes of many illnesses such as poor circulation throughout the body, inflammation, and cells entering a state of shock where they stop functioning and eventually die.

DMSO, in turn, has repeatedly been shown to be remarkably effective for a wide range of disorders including:

Strokes, paralysis, a wide range of neurological disorders (e.g., Down Syndrome and dementia), and many circulatory disorders (e.g., Raynaud’s, varicose veins, hemorrhoids), which I discussed here.

A wide range of tissue injuries, such as sprains, concussions, burns, surgical incisions, and spinal cord injuries (discussed here).

Chronic pain (e.g., from a bad disc, bursitis, arthritis, or complex regional pain syndrome), which I discussed here.

A wide range of autoimmune, protein, and contractile disorders, such as scleroderma, amyloidosis, and interstitial cystitis (discussed here).

A variety of head conditions, such as tinnitus, vision loss, dental problems, and sinusitis (discussed here).

A wide range of internal organ diseases, such as pancreatitis, infertility, liver cirrhosis, and endometriosis (discussed here).

A wide range of skin conditions, such as burns, varicose veins, acne, hair loss, ulcers, skin cancer, and many autoimmune dermatologic diseases (discussed here).

Many challenging infectious conditions, including chronic bacterial infections, herpes, and shingles (discussed here).

Many aspects of cancer (e.g., many of cancer’s debilitating symptoms, making cancer treatments more potent, greatly reducing the toxicity of conventional therapies, and turning cancer cells back into normal cells), which I discussed here.

Note: most of the above have also been shown for ultraviolet blood irradiation. Likewise, similar data exists for ozone, another umbrella remedy that I plan to focus on once the DMSO series is finished.

Additionally, DMSO possesses a unique ability to enhance the absorption of medications and natural therapies by facilitating their passage into the body. This property has transformed the way conventional and natural medicine is practiced, opening up nearly limitless possibilities for incredible therapeutic combinations (discussed here), and most importantly, DMSO is extremely safe (provided it's used correctly).

As such, a wealth of data (detailed in the above articles) has accumulated, showing DMSO has a high rate of efficacy in a wide range of conditions. Since DMSO was widely available, it quickly spread like wildfire across America in the 1960s (particularly due to how rapidly it alleviated “incurable” pain). Regrettably, the FDA then stepped in and went to war with DMSO to protect the status quo. In the decades that followed, despite the public, the scientific community, and Congress petitioning the FDA to rescind their prohibition on DMSO, it all fell on deaf ears.

In turn, this continued until the 1994 DSHEA act (passed in response to the public outrage over the FDA raiding supplement providers at gunpoint) simply took away the FDA’s ability to regulate natural medicines that DMSO was able to re-enter the marketplace. Still, sadly by this time, despite thousands of studies supporting its use, many American pharmaceutical products using DMSO and it being widely used outside the United States, DMSO had become another forgotten side of medicine.

As what they did to DMSO has always really bothered me (particularly due to its ability to rescue people from a life of debility after strokes or spinal cord injuries), I decided to try publicizing it here and do all that I could to give the strong case for its use. Due to the trust this publication has created, many readers here were willing to try it. Much like the 1960s, when it first emerged, it rapidly caught on (e.g., despite my best efforts to prevent this, there have been numerous DMSO supply shortages—a few of which have led to my colleagues being quite upset with me) since that time.

Just as miraculous, I've received numerous testimonials from readers around the world about the life-changing effects DMSO has had on them. Recognizing the importance of not letting these stories become forgotten, I’ve devoted a significant amount of time to compiling them all here. While I know I’ve missed a lot (since they appear in so many places), there are now over 3,000 of them.

The majority of those testimonials match the well recognized functions of DMSO, but at the same time, I’ve received many astonishing ones I had not anticipated, and come to realize that in many cases, DMSO is a better (particularly in regards to cost) therapy than what I had long been using to treat many different conditions. Put differently, since there are so many different applications of DMSO, I would have never become aware of some of them had I not unearthed and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of literature in the process of compiling this series, and for that reason, I’m immensely grateful I did!

In those testimonials, one of the things that caught my eye was that numerous people shared that DMSO had either improved or reversed their COPD (or pulmonary fibrosis). These chronic, debilitating lung conditions are very difficult to treat within the standard medical paradigm. One reader for example, Rebecca Cunningham, shared that DMSO had saved her beloved neighbor from COPD (“I am LITERALLY watching a miracle happen”), and after an X post I made about it went viral, decided to make a short and to the point video about what had happened and how profound it was to both her and her neighbor. I was deeply moved by it and realized I needed to write an article on this topic, as it encapsulates what many are suffering through and what those close to them experience.

His experiences were not unique, and I have received many similar stories (most of which can also be viewed online where they were posted). To make this as concise as possible, I condensed these details to their essentials (e.g., many readers expressed their sincere appreciation and valued their subscriptions, which I appreciate; however, I removed these comments from the article’s body). One of the things I find noteworthy about these is how often they had not intended to cure their lung issue, but rather it happened incidentally while using DMSO for something like pain (which mirrors how the early DMSO investigators incidentally discovered DMSO restores lost eyesight).

I was also told I had emphysema in the upper part of my lungs. I had 2 strokes due to a clogged left carotid. I had purchased DMSO to apply on my scar the scar diminished pretty quickly. I also rub it on my chest. Then I purchased a nebulizer, added 70/30 DMOO. Did the treatment everyday for a 1 week, now on maintenance a twice a weekly. This is how I cured my COPD. I also apply a drop to my ear to lessen the noise from tinnitus, it didn't get rid of it completely, but the noise went from 35 decibels to five, I can live with this. I also take it twice a week orally to deal with stomach issues which I alternate with CD.

Thank you for posting this. I have severe COPD. I’ve been using DMSO for about 2 weeks now and it’s a big change for me. So Thanks again.

I'm currently using DMSO and distilled water in a nebulizer treatment and its done wonders for my breathing issues [COPD, was a smoker for 30+ years and has asthma most of life]. Been doing this for nearly 4 weeks now and I no longer feel the need to use daily so I'm cutting back to every other day.

Thank you for your efforts on Jenny's behalf. She is now about ten days into Dan's —[COPD DMSO nebulization] process. She has seen positive effect, especially the loss of panic/despair.

Been using it in a nebuliser with saline for almost a week and what a difference. Was told ventolin is extremely dangerous by the local health centre so after decades of allowing me to take it with their blessing, science has decided it’s bad. Not missing it.

Is it possible that continual application of DMSO cream to my husbands bad back could be helping his lungs? He seems to have more energy, is doing more, and I'm wondering! I cover his whole back, shoulders and side ribs down to the bottom each morning.

It’s amazing...he's 85, with pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema and he's getting stronger, refused his wheelchair to go to church yesterday, makes the coffee for me before going to bed, and ONLY DMSO back rub and sunlight are different. This was unexpected, and the docs around here don't seem to have ever heard of DMSO!!! Thanks so much. I don't want to lose him!

I am using DMSO via a nebulizer, (as well as topically) and it seems to be showing significant improvement in my lungs! I was on 4 liters and now use NO supplemental Oxygen or any other medicine for my lungs, (I was also taking Trelogy). Despite decades of excessive smoking and drinking) and I am seeing remarkable results.

DMSO helps my husband's lungs when I rub his back and rib cage.... And helps with his chronic pain from failed back surgery! We are old, but we don't take or need NSAIDS anymore! It's a miracle!

We started DMSO gradually to make sure there were no bad effects [for COPD]. First topical 50/50 DMSO & aloe Vera on his chest for a week, then a 50/50 mix with distilled water in his nebulizer 1x a day. after 3 days, he was so blown away by the positive results…he is in his late 70's.

My most noticeable change using DMSO is my lungs (e.g., breathing was noticeable and the cough stopped in the first couple of weeks). Had a 2 week break and got was in bed for a week with flu like symptoms. Usually I reach for steroids so I can breathe, but not so this time. Dr ordered bloods, asked me what am I doing, as the results were so good.

I found out about DMSO about a week ago and did the research and started using it 50/50 DMSO/Distilled water. I have COPD. DMSO has helped tremendously. I'm blown away and ecstatically happier. We have a major wild fire right now too and I can breathe! I mean DEEP breaths.

I came across the video of the man on all the copd meds. I've been diagnosed with this also even though I quit smoking 40years ago. I have tried DMSO and I am so very thankful for this. I can breath better after 10 days nebulizing just 5 drops with saline every other day and my energy is returning.....Thank You!!!!!!!

Okay, decades of smoking and drinking ruined my lungs - I knew it, but I was unable to stop at that point in my life. I'd had an operation to cut off some of the ruined parts of my lungs, (____ Univ Hosp) and that did not go well - Bullous Emphysema. Long and short, I was bedridden and on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen. Trying to get upstairs in my home to shower was the biggest impediment in front of me at that time. I had gained weight, (I've lost 45 lbs and still need to lose about 5 lbs more) and my muscles had atrophied tremendously. I was tremendously depressed and ready, (in my mind) to die.

Then, my motivation to get better was put into overdrive as [my wife was] diagnosed with Stage IV cancer…I was all she had and I had to learn to cook and manage all other duties in our household. I was lugging around physical tanks of O2 and this simply was not a possibility - even with help from friends and family. Through various exercise programs focused upon breathing, I was able to get off the supplement, but I knew I would not be able to continue without the extra O2 unless I did something else [and over the next two years tried everything I could but nothing worked].

I had joined an online group, where folks were talking about alternative medicine approaches. On this forum, it was suggested drinking DMSO which I tried; unfortunately, it left a scent on my breath that seriously bothered my wife.

Then, I realized I had a nebulizer packaged up and sitting in storage. Wise or stupid, I decided to try it as everything I'd heard, read, or experienced led me to believe this solution would benefit me more than harm me [and through trial and error figured out how to do it correctly].

[Before long] I was finally able to make it to our basement, (we had purchased an elliptical back when we were healthy) and "walk" for 30 minutes [on an elliptical]. I can, slowly, accomplish most any household chore as well as shopping, light yard work, etc. [and] do see my blood O2 increase to 100% which I could not achieve before and a lower heart rate accompanying that.

I had a patient with scleroderma and interstitial lung disease (which had put them on the transplant list) but after receiving DMSO, the lung recovered and they no longer need a transplant. I also just saw a patient with sarcoidosis treating himself with dmso nebulized. He said it made a big difference—James Miller MD

## Pulmonary DMSO Data
A few months ago, while researching DMSO combination therapies, I realized the German DMSO community had done the most work in this area (particularly in regards to natural therapies) and began extensively studying their work. In parallel, about a month ago, I realized there was a way to access and summarize thousands of DMSO studies from Russia, China, Germany, and South America, so most of my focus recently has gone into trying to compile it (along with the similar data on UVBI). From that, I discovered that there is a lot more data supporting the use of DMSO (and UVBI) in a wide range of lung conditions than I had originally anticipated. Likewise, I have found many studies showing UVBI produces similar effects to those detailed below for DMSO.

Note: doing this is exhausting, but for the next few years I plan to continue, in part because it’s helping a lot of people, but more importantly because right now (due to RFK, MAHA, and the Republican push to reduce deficit spending) is the best chance we will have in our lifetimes for these immensely cost-saving therapies to be adopted. As such, I want to give each of them the best chance to succeed, and as the DMSO experience shows, if you clearly present the forgotten data in a relatable manner, forgotten truths can quickly go viral.

## Lung Injury
DMSO’s ability to rescue damaged cells from death, stabilize cell membranes, reduce harmful inflammatory processes (which often set in after injuries or loss of blood), and restore the microcirculation have allowed it to be invaluable for a myriad of diseases within the internal organs (e.g., pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, or infarctions to any organ). As such, DMSO also protects the lungs from devastating injuries.
Note: if you cannot access the Chinese or Russian studies, it often requires using a VPN until you find an acceptable IP, as these databases are to some extent, restricted to their region.

Supporting studies include:

•DMSO was found to prevent significant inflammation and tissue injury, which follows a significant traumatic impact on the lungs.

•In mice exposed to lethal radiation doses, oral DMSO prior to radiation allowed all to survive, and protected many parts of the body including the lungs.

•DMSO prevented injuries from respiratory anoxia (being unable to breathe air in).

•Following cold-restraint stress, DMSO reduced lipid peroxidation and stress-induced injuries in the stomach and lungs.1,2,3

•In rats with lung injury caused by blood flow loss and restoration, treatment with 5% DMSO reduced lung swelling, lowered harmful inflammation markers, and decreased mitochondrial DNA release, helping protect lung tissue by calming the body's inflammatory response. Separately, DMSO (5% at 5 ml/kg) given two hours before the injury, reduced lung tissue swelling and damage, [lowered the wet-to-dry weight ratio] inflammation, and inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α), while lowering harmful mitochondrial DNA expression1,2
Note: another study also found DMSO prevented lung ischemia-reperfusion injuries.

•DMSO was found to prevent lung injury from hemorrhagic shock (significant blood loss) and transfusing lost fluids back into the circulation. Similar results were also observed when the artery to the lungs was temporarily cut off to create that blood loss.

•In the lungs, DMSO suppresses the activity of caspase proteins (which trigger cell death and inflammation).

Note: I have also seen a few reports of people improving pulmonary emboli with DMSO, such as by applying to the site of a known clot (which if you decide to do so, must be done in conjunction with conventional care as PE’s are life-threatening).

## COPD and Pulmonary Fibrosis
As the previous section shows, these properties strongly suggest DMSO can counteract many of the disease processes which cause the lungs to fail. Furthermore, as mentioned before, significant data shows DMSO can often revive failing tissues or organs,1,2 reduce inflammation, and effectively reduce fibrosis throughout the body.

As such, DMSO has been repeatedly shown to improve lung fibrosis:

•DMSO at 0.5-3%, in a dose dependent fashion, roughly halved the proliferation of fibroblast cells, suggesting it could reduce the fibrosis seen in chronic lung diseases. Likewise DMSO at 1.42-3.55% halved the water permeability of fibroblast membranes, likely reducing their release of inflammatory cytokines.

•In 82 Wistar rats with experimentally induced silicosis, DMSO (2 ml/kg) reduced pulmonary fibrosis, lowering hydroxyproline (from 84.85 mg/g vs. 1243.27 mg/g) and malondialdehyde levels and normalizing lung white blood cell counts.

•DMSO reduced chronic pulmonary fibrosis, particularly when combined with zinc.

Likewise, beyond preventing damage to the lungs, DMSO’s healing properties have been shown to address the most critical aspect of chronic lung diseases, the inability to bring oxygen into the body:

•DMSO was found to prevent oxygen deprivation and inability to exchange gasses through the lungs, which results from an Ehrlichia ruminantium infection (which is typically fatal).

•For older patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency (leading to chronically low blood oxygen levels, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and an abnormal acid base balance, especially during exercises) due to issues in the lungs or bronchi, daily intramuscular DMSO was found to bring about a recovery without the need for hospitalization in 35/43 (81%).

Note: other studies have also shown that DMSO helps with chronic non-specific lung diseases and preventing the pulmonary fibrosis frequently caused by certain chemotherapy drugs.

## Toxic Exposures
DMSO has helped me though. I have a weak heart and lungs due to 10 years of exposure to chlorine in a pool. My chest pain instantly retreats when I use it as well as tinnitus when I apply to my forehead.

Note: I have also read a report of DMSO curing a chronic lung issue following a Teflon inhalation (from a heated pan).

In many cases, chronic lung issues come from either severe respiratory exposure to a toxin or numerous small ones. For example, I know numerous people who developed chronic lung issues or had exacerbations of existing chronic neuroimmune illnesses after exposure to wildfire smoke. Extensive research from Hawaii has shown the majority of those in the Lahaina fire two years later still have symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, weakness, breathing issues, sore throats, eye irritation, chest pain or tightness, nausea, vomiting, anxiety and suicidal thoughts).1,2

As such, there is significant evidence particulate matter exposure (e.g., from car exhaust, air pollution, or cigarettes) damages the blood vessels and is well known to increase cardiovascular disease and death.1,2,3 Coal miners with a high coal particulate exposure for example, are more than twice as likely to die from heart disease, and in rats, coal dust inhalation has been found to cause atherosclerosis. Likewise, dense wildfire smoke exposure has been shown to increase ER visits amongst adults 65 and older by 42 percent for heart attacks and 22 percent for ischemic heart disease.

Additionally, I believe part of this is due to smoke particles having a positive charge, which both impairs zeta potential (what makes essential circulation possible within the body), and reduces the motion of cilia in the airway (demonstrated by a pivotal 1958 study of positive and negative ion airway exposure), making the body unable to clear harmful particulates from the airway—an issue also well recognized to occur in chronic smokers.1,2,3,4,5,6,7
Note: many physicians in the past have found that breathing negative ions significantly improves chronic breathing issues, and a 1958 study also found the same.

In turn, DMSO has been shown to significantly reduce the damage caused by airway toxins. For example:

•After sheep experienced a lung injury from inhaling smoke, administering nebulized DMSO (with heparin) an hour post-injury (and then every 4 hours) was found to reduce the damage to their lungs significantly with no treated animals dying (whereas all untreated ones did within 72 hours). Similar results were also seen in another study.

•Another sheep smoke-inhalation study found nebulized DMSO plus heparin or N-acetylcysteine resulted in a 100% recovery rate. Both this and the previous studies found DMSO was more effective than the other therapies, but the greatest effect was seen when they were combined.

•In human lung cells, cooking oil fume condensate caused genetic damage, increasing DNA breaks, micronucleus frequency, and multinucleated cells—which DMSO effectively reduced. Additionally, 0.5% DMSO was shown to inhibit the formation of reactive oxygen species reducing oxidative damage and lactate dehydrogenase release.

•Giving DMSO before alloxan (a toxin) was found to prevent the inflammation, cellular damage, and edema alloxan causes in the lungs.

•Many disinfectants have been created by combining them with DMSO. One which combined formaldehyde vapor with DMSO, beyond being more potent was less irritating to the lungs than formaldehyde alone.

•In human lung cells exposed to harmful cigarette smoke, a mixture of tea polyphenols and DMSO provided strong protection by significantly reducing DNA damage, chromosome abnormalities, and gene mutations, showing that DMSO combined with antioxidants can help shield cells from smoke-related genetic harm.1,2

Note: since smoking is quite challenging to quit, this hence implies DMSO could be taken to counteract the harmful effects of that habit. I do not believe this is wise, as one study that combined DMSO soluble particles with cigarette smoke found low doses protected the vascular smooth muscles (while higher doses—which would likely be exceeded with chronic smoking—increased the harm and cell death in the blood vessels) and likewise, cigarette smoke particles dissolved in DMSO were found to increase the contractility of arteries in the brain. As such, I believe if someone with COPD plans to implement a DMSO nebulization protocol, they must first be done with smoking.

## Depleted Uranium
Various isotopes of uranium exist. While all are radioactive, only 0.7% is U-235, the type that undergoes chain nuclear reactions. As such, most nuclear technologies rely upon obtaining large amounts of uranium and extracting the U-235 for either for nuclear power or nuclear weapons (which is hard to do and hence why most countries lack the enrichment capacity to make nuclear weapons). Because of this, a lot of (still radioactive) waste U-238 exists which is referred to as “depleted uranium” or DU), and over the years, the military realized it was an excellent munition both due to its density (allowing it to destroy lower density metal armors) and it sharpening upon impact.

This process unfortunately causes large amounts of dust. There has been significant controversy around this, such as DU poisoning being nearly impossible to cure, it being linked to Gulf War Syndrome along with cancers and birth defects in the countries where we deployed the munitions (e.g., in the earlier days of the internet where only flash videos existed I saw a rather disturbing video about Iraqi babies).
Note: one of Russia’s major contentions during the Ukraine war was the Ukrainians being trained in and supplied with depleted uranium weapons (e.g., because it would permanently contaminate the area with toxic radioactive dust).

I mention all of this because one of the most unexpected things I discovered within the Chinese DMSO literature is that they have repeatedly studied DMSO’s ability to antidote DU poisoning.

Collectively, the nine studies I located show DMSO has repeatedly demonstrated significant protective effects against DU and uranium mine dust induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity (e.g., in BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells). For example, DU exposure generates damaging reactive oxygen species, which DMSO counteracts, thereby reducing DNA single-strand breaks, micronucleus formation, multinucleate cell frequencies, and HPRT gene mutation rates (in part by enhancing cell membrane permeability to support repair mechanisms).1,2,3 It also mitigates uranium dust-induced DNA damage and lowers mutation frequency. In combination with tea polyphenols (TP), DMSO significantly reduced chromosomal damage, H2AX protein phosphorylation, and HPRT mutations, with the TP-DMSO mixture showing superior protection due to synergistic antioxidant effects and improved membrane penetration.1,2 DMSO further preserves cell survival by decreasing apoptosis and necrosis, minimizing organelle damage (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria),1,2 and partially restoring MAPK signaling pathways (ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK) disrupted by DU. These protective effects are dose-dependent, so the higher DMSO concentrations most reduce DU-induced damage.

Finally, a rabbit study found that intraperitoneal DMSO administered prior to a 20 Gy (lethal) dose of radiation to the chest significantly reduced the damage to their lungs (e.g., the integrity of the alveolocapillary membrane was maintained, there were no debris in the air sacs, and the lung’s microstructure remained unaffected)—all of which shows DMSO offered significant protection from acute radiation poisoning.

## Cystic Fibrosis
There is some data suggesting DMSO can improve the abnormal proteins which characterize cystic fibrosis, dissolve excessive mucus, and provide helpful antibacterial effects. Currently, I only know of one case where it was used for the condition which was recently shared with me by a colleague.

I am currently treating a 45 year old CF patient with DMSO and glutathione. She was in the beginning stages of getting worked up for lung transplant. We'll have PFT's from before treatment and updates every 3 months starting in August. 1 month in, she's feeling like a teenager again, exercising and has been illness free for 4 weeks now, which is the longest period without antibiotics since she was in her 20's. She tells me I can share all the details of her case if you'd find them useful.

## Respiratory Infections
My English bulldog had a very stubborn case of pneumonia. She was on three different antibiotics over an eight week period & nothing seemed to help. Then we added DMSO to the treatment protocol! 1 week later her lungs were clear.

As I showed here, DMSO is often immensely beneficial for many different infections, particularly when combined with other antimicrobial agents, as DMSO both enhances their ability to penetrate into (and throughout) the body and, by penetrating microbes, remove their antimicrobial resistance. As such, a lot of research (and many readers) has shown DMSO can frequently treat chronic infections or life threatening infections that do not respond to standard treatments, and in many cases, do so by simply being combined with a natural antimicrobial rather than a potentially toxic pharmaceutical drug.

As pneumonia is one the top causes of hospital admissions (and hospital deaths), this is quite helpful. Over the years, significant data has accumulated showing this combination is quite beneficial for respiratory infections (particularly since DMSO also reduces the harmful inflammation and edema associated with lung infections).

For example, tuberculosis is the most deadly infection in the world, particularly due to its ever increasing antibiotic resistance. Many lab studies (summarize here) have shown DMSO directly inhibits the bacteria’s growth and increases its sensitivity to the antibiotics used to treat the infection by 3 to 200 times,1,2,3,4 including in bacterial extracts from tuberculosis patients.1,2 Likewise, in guinea pigs with isoniazid resistant tuberculosis, all died despite isoniazid treatment, whereas if DMSO was given prior to it, they all survived.

As such, many studies have found that DMSO dramatically improves outcomes for tuberculosis (e.g., in patients with destructive pulmonary and endobronchial tuberculosis who received nebulized antibiotics mixed in DMSO, in children to heal destructive cavities from tuberculosis, and in children who contracted tuberculosis from contaminated vaccines).

DMSO has been shown to treat acute respiratory diseases (e.g., acute stenosing laryngotracheobronchitis in children and suppurative lung diseases). Similarly, it increases the antibiotic sensitivity of many other lung infections (such as Rhodococcus equi strains isolated from foals). For example, in 2020, a Libyan hospital reported administering 16.67% DMSO and 2.78% ceftriaxone (diluted in saline) via a chest tube or endotracheal cannula to 31 patients with lung abscesses, all of whom experienced complete recovery and no recurrence.

Likewise, DMSO has been reported to treat many bronchopulmonary diseases (e.g., ones study reported DMSO effectively aided in the complex conservative treatment of acute and chronic pleural empyema in 485 patients, notably reducing preoperative preparation time for chronic cases)

Note: many have reported successfully curing chronic lung infections (or coughs or sinusitis) with nebulized DMSO, often mixed with a natural antimicrobial. Most commonly,, this is done with oxidizing therapies (e.g., chlorine dioxide or hydrogen peroxide). If you plan to use these, it is critical to start with low doses and not exceed your lungs tolerance.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
ARDS, a life-threatening condition where the alveoli fill with fluid and then collapse (which typically follows severe pneumonia), is quite challenging to treat (and a common reason people end up on ventilators). Fortunately, many studies have shown DMSO helps the condition:

Note: this study also found DMSO prevents acute pulmonary edema (a more common form of fluid accumulation within the lungs).

•In rats with ARDS, intraperitoneal DMSO and ginsenosides maintained blood oxygen levels and superoxide dismutase activity reduced plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. It also reduced plasma protein and red blood cell leakage into the lungs and significantly protected the capillary alveolar lining. When vitamin E was given as well, lung injury further decreased and lung fluid accumulation was also reduced (evidenced by a reduced wet lung-to-body weight ratio).

•In rats, intraperitoneal DMSO 30 minutes prior to an ARDS triggering LPS injection preserved pulmonary capillary endothelial cell by maintaining luminal ATPase activity at near-normal levels and prevented ultrastructural damage to capillary endothelium and alveolar type I epithelium at 24 hours. DMSO also improved survival, with 100% of DMSO-treated rats surviving 24 hours compared to 58% of saline-treated rats.

•In hamsters with ARDS, subsequent DMSO reduced the inflammation and fluid in the lungs significantly. Identical results were found in a mouse study (with ARDS being triggered by LPS) where DMSO prevented LPS damage, kept all treated mice from dying (whereas 58% of controls died), and maintained the ability of the lungs to produce ATP.

In the one human study where DMSO was used for ARDS (given intravenously at concentrations under 10%) it was found to produce a dramatic improvement in all three patients who received it (e.g., one patient’s lungs were completely normal after a week) and prior to receiving DMSO all three were near death. Additionally, in the one case when DMSO was nebulized, the improvement occurred in 1 hour.


Note: another study found that DMSO reduced immune cell infiltration of a lung infection, which can both be beneficial (as it explains how DMSO prevents the immune system from attacking the lungs in severe respiratory conditions), but also problematic if not done in conjunction with an antimicrobial therapy, can leave you inadequately defended against it

## Asthma
Many readers with asthma have shared DMSO changed their life:

Holy moly, this is crazy. Dosed this weekend, 3 days, taking a short break (just can't have that odor during office hours), and already my asthma is almost non-existent. Beyond belief.

I’ve been using DMSO for about a week now for a rather persistent asthma [and sudden heart palpitations]…and have felt a marked improvement to my asthma! I went from using my inhaler more than I have in awhile (and taking quercetin recommended by my naturopath with very little relief) to now using nothing but DMSO and feeling like my chest has opened entirely and I can take entire deep breaths! I went on a walk this morning and cruised up rather steep hills without barely any increase in my respirations! That never happens. Usually I’m huffing and puffing and my chest is super tight. The palpitations have also disappeared.

Been using it in a nebuliser with saline for almost a week and what a difference. Was told ventolin is extremely dangerous by the local health centre so after decades of allowing me to take it with their blessing, science has decided it’s bad. I’m 66 and have had asthma since I was 9 months old.

About Asthma DMSO for me is sthg like a miracle. I started to use DMSO April 2nd this year. In the first days together with Ivermectin. The reason for taking was my paradontose. 21st of April I was after 5 decades of being dependent on sprays free, till now! Thank you 🙂

The DMSO I’ve been taking for my asthma is night and day. I can breathe! 😊

I’ve been using [DMSO] a week and am feeling fantastic overall and my asthma is non existent right now. I was really struggling with it lately before starting this. Energy too is coming back

Greetings! I'm 59 years old. I've had asthma since my early teens which gets set off by my allergies. Within days of starting to take 1 tablespoon of DMSO per day, I was able to use my albuterol inhaler less. Now it's been months since I last used it. I used to need an inhaler every time I played table tennis, but now never. I feel less sensitive to dust, although certainly not cured.

I inhaled DMSO spray accidently when making a castor oil pack. The vapors filled up the room and I left the room asap as I thought it would be dangerous to inhale. I was having some difficulty with asthma. That evening my lungs were completely cleared. Who knew! 😊

I’ve been using DMSO since November 2024 (big improvement in veins and circulation. That is helping my severe asthma amazingly.

My nephew, a welder, started using dmso for his hands. The pain subsided. He suffered with severe asthma. He discovered soon after that he wasn’t using his inhaler any longer.

My grandpa had horrible asthma, he started nebulizing DMSO in the early 90’s and he no longer needed rescue inhalers. Lived till 94, survived multiple strokes with no side effects, and amazed doctors by how quickly he recovered. He always said it was the DMSO

I have asthma and [inhaling DMSO] was really helped.

I started using it for my asthma. I feel so much better..

DSMO has greatly improved my asthma. 👍

I get pains with asthma and DMSO usually relieves the pain

I apply it topically to my chest to help asthma.

Including on lovely one about their cat:

My 20 yr old cat developed a cough which the vet diagnosed as asthma. He wanted to put her on an inhaler, but I had my doubts that she would tolerate that. So I tried using DMSO on the back of her neck…No coughing at all. Amazing stuff.

Note: DMSO authors have also shared numerous asthma stories, and the German DMSO community has reported significant success in treating asthma with DMSO. Likewise, many have reported certain DMSO applications have helped their pollen allergies.

Some data supports these accounts:

•In mice with asthma, DMSO 0.5 g/kg intraperitoneal, 10% solution) significantly reduced the proportion of TCD4 cells (which in asthma play a key role in airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness) within their mesenteric lymph nodes).1,2

•DMSO has a dose-dependent effect on the induced expression and release of inflammatory mediators in bronchial epithelial cells. Likewise, in human bronchial epithelial cells, at low doses DMSO increased the production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (increasing the immune response against infections and facilitating tissue repair), while at high doses, DMSO suppressed it (hence reducing chronic inflammation).

•A study gave 153 adults (84 men and 69 women) DMSO mixed with a bronchodilator, a steroid, and an antihistamine all administered by intramuscular injections of whom 43 of whom had frequent asthmatic crises (with asymptomatic periods) and 110 with more intense and frequent crises (despite receiving the standard therapies for asthma). After being evaluated for all the standard pulmonary assessments, 37 (24.5%) had an excellent result, 92 (60%) had a good response, while 24 (15.5%) had no change).1,2

•Numerous studies have found DMSO increases the potency of steroids (which are a mainstay of asthma and COPD treatment), making it possible for much lower doses to be used.1,2,3.4 As steroids often have significant toxicity (particularly when used at high doses for prolonged periods), this can be quite useful.

Note: there unfortunately are not any other studies I am aware of (other than one on rats that did not find anything particularly relevant), which again highlights that there is so much to study about DMSO most of the needed studies have not been done (due to the FDA ending all research shortly after the scientific community embraced studying as many aspects of DMSO as possible). Fortunately, a great deal of research on UVBI treating asthma has been conducted (which I compiled here).

## Treating Respiratory Conditions
I started to use [DMSO] to see if I could control my sinusitis…My sinusitis improved almost from day one, I no longer feel the mucous running at the back of my throat and, in the morning, I don’t experience anymore the intense coughing I used to have everyday.

It is incredible. I treated my 4 day very serious sinus/cold/flu this week and it was the only thing that helped. I even nebulized peroxide, iodine, and silver before that. The DMSO was a lifesaver.

A variety of methods and protocols exist for using DMSO to treat conditions afflicting the lungs (or sinuses). In many instances, I observe that the concentrations people use are far above what the DMSO community advises, which results in issues for the individuals, but nonetheless persists despite these problems because of the rapid improvement they experience.

In turn, as more people have begun experimenting with nebulization (which must be done at a low dose), I felt it was essential to write this article.

In the final part of this article, I will review the existing protocols for using DMSO to treat respiratory conditions, along with providing guidance on other treatments for them (e.g., nebulized glutathione) and more general information on how to use DMSO for individuals wishing to use it for other issues (e.g., pain) and where to obtain it (remarkably despite DMSO costing almost nothing, a striking number of counterfeit and scam DMSO products are starting to emerge—which is sadly a testament to the world we live in).

## Sourcing DMSO:
Since there are numerous options when purchasing DMSO, I’ve frequently received many questions about the best brands to use. Of these, I’ve long believed that these are the three best options (and I’ve included Amazon links for your purchase).

Note: unless you feel confident in diluting them correctly, opt for the 70% dilution, as that concentration typically works for most people.

•Jacob Lab (e.g., this gel or this liquid)—which is 99.98% pure.

•The DMSO Store (e.g., this gel or this liquid—which can also be bought directly from www.DMSOStore.com)—which is 99.995% pure (and hence often the most popular for internal applications).

•Nature’s Gift (e.g., this gel or this liquid)—which is 99.9% pure.

Note: dmso.store is a completely different company than dmsostore.com.

When buying liquid DMSO, I believe it should always be sold in a glass container unless the plastic container is DMSO resistant (which many are not—hence why I only recommended buying glass bottles) and likewise have a DMSO resistant cap. If you buy gel, it’s okay if it’s sold in plastic.
Note: many people have used liquid DMSO from plastic containers without issue, but I have personally always avoided doing so because glass DMSO has always been affordable and readily available so less thinking is involved to ensure it’s sold in a DMSO resistant plastic.

Of the currently existing options, I believe the best choice is to either:

•Buy DMSO directly from the DMSO store (DMSOstore.com).
Note: the website DMSO.store is for a completely different company.

•Buy it directly from Jacob lab (which readers have informed me is also shipping DMSO in plastic they claim is DMSO resistant—which it likely is, since Stanley Jacob’s son runs the company, and from talking to him, we know he is very dedicated to continuing his father’s work).

Note: I’ve now spoken to numerous people who purchased DMSO from someone promoting it online, and then shared that either they were scammed (nothing arrived after they paid) or the product that arrived wasn’t correct. People who engage in these types of activities tend to gravitate towards whatever is the “hot” item, and since DMSO is the current trend, I believe it is best to go with a longstanding vendor. Additionally, local sources of it (e.g., from Tractor Supply) are more than good enough for people’s immediate needs (e.g., an injury), but not ideal when preparing DMSO combinations (rather, I prefer the higher purity options available).

## DMSO dosing:
One of the challenges of using DMSO is that there's significant variation in what each individual responds to best. Because of this, throughout this series, I attempted to provide a detailed explanation that accounts for each possibility, which may be too complicated for many readers (but I still advise reading).

However, most of it boils down to the following:

•If you use too high a dose, you risk the chance of having a bad reaction (which dozens of people have now told me made them not want) to use DMSO anymore, whereas if you use too low of a dose, the effect will be much less than desired (which may also lead to them abandoning DMSO). In turn, I’ve had many people here who:

•Applied 100% DMSO topically and had trouble believing anyone couldn’t tolerate that.

•Applied 70% DMSO topically, had a bit of irritation but thought it was manageable.

•Applies 30% topically and felt it was too strong.

Similarly with oral dosing, I’ve had people who:

•Thought 1 teaspoon was decent but quickly took more for a greater effect.

•Found a few drops was the optimal dose for them (and greatly benefitted), whereas 1 teaspoon while initially good, ended up feeling like it was too much for them and caused their sensitive system to react.

Because of this, you essentially have two options, and have to decide which is right for you:

• Be patient and start with a low dose that you can build up.

•Start a strong dose and agree not to hold it against me or DMSO if you don’t tolerate it.

In the previous articles, I’ve advocated for the former. Still, many understandably started with a high dose as they did not want to wait for the results, a few of whom then shared they’d had a skin reaction that made them hesitant to continue using DMSO.

Similarly, when using DMSO, there are two common routes of administration: oral and topical. Orally, it is much stronger, but likewise, the GI tract is more sensitive to higher concentrations of DMSO. For this reason, I typically suggest starting with topical DMSO before doing oral DMSO. However, for more systemic issues (e.g., joint pain throughout the body or low energy), oral administration is often necessary (and in many cases works well if done in conjunction with topical DMSO).

Likewise, there is a very small risk (1 in 1-2000) of an allergic reaction, so it’s generally advised to begin by patch testing DMSO on the skin before taking it orally.

## So, What is Patch Testing?
Patch testing is a method used to determine how the application reacts to a product. It's a smart way to test a small area first before applying the product to larger areas, which helps to identify any adverse reactions.

## How to Patch Test:

•Select a Small Area: Choose a discreet spot.
•Apply a Tiny Amount: Use a small quantity of the product.
•Wait and Observe: Leave it on for 24 hours unless you notice irritation sooner.
• Proceed if All’s Good: If there’s no reaction, feel confident in using the product as intended.

*If in contact with the skin: Some individuals may experience itching, tingling sensations, and irritation, which are normal. If you experience any signs of an allergic reaction (e.g., swelling), wash the affected area immediately and discontinue use.

That said for general DMSO use (without going into all the nuances and additional details), I advise the following:

Start with 30-50% DMSO and see how you tolerate it. When applying to the face, ensure that all makeup has been thoroughly washed off (ideally using only natural cosmetic products) and use a lower concentration (20%).

If you have no issue, gradually raise it to 70%.

Only raise it past 70% if you are certain you are one of those people who is fine with 100% or you are using it for a specific application that can justify a higher concentration (e.g., a collagen contracture, a scar, an internal adhesion or an acute stroke).

Until you are comfortable with topical applications, avoid oral applications, and only use them if you think you need them (or topical treatments are not working for a reason other than an allergic reaction).

For oral dosing, start with a teaspoon of 70% or 100% DMSO mixed into a glass of water (you may also want juice or milk to eliminate DMSO’s taste), as a heavily diluted solution is best to start with

If you experience issues with that, try lowering the dose to half a teaspoon and then to a quarter teaspoon.

Otherwise, stay at a teaspoon for at least three days, and then if you think you need a stronger effect, go to 2 teaspoons.

Consuming more than 3 teaspoons of liquid in a glass of water is excessive, and at that point, it is better to divide the dose throughout the day.

With both topical and oral DMSO, people generally find that their tolerance to it improves over time. Conversely, if it’s used too frequently, a tolerance can develop, so it’s typically advised not to take it 1-2 days a week.

Note: more detailed instructions on oral (and IV) DMSO use can be found here, while more detailed instructions on topical uses can be found here.

The key point is that everyone has a different tolerance to DMSO. The most common negative piece of feedback I receive is “I used [a high concentration of] DMSO, I had a common unpleasant reaction such as burning [which is frequently seen when too high a DMSO dose is used], and I never want to use DMSO again.”

Higher doses are often more effective (and many users use 100% without any issues whatsoever), but it's best to start with a low dose and be patient. I do not like to berate others, but regardless of how many times I say this, the previously described scenario still happens.

Regarding the concentrations used, I generally advise purchasing 70% DMSO because people rarely react to it (e.g., the DMSO was found to be the concentration that offered the best balance between safety and efficacy). It doesn’t require any significant calculations to dose appropriately (e.g., you can apply it topically as it is, or mix it with equal parts of purified water to get it to roughly 35%). However, you can also achieve this with 100% DMSO (e.g., dilute it to roughly 50% by mixing it with equal parts of purified water, or to roughly 33% by mixing it with two parts of purified water). Finally, certain parts of the body, particularly the face, tend to be more sensitive to higher concentrations of DMSO, so you should start at lower strengths in those areas.

If you are applying DMSO to the face, start with a concentration of 30% and avoid using a stronger concentration, as this can cause significant skin irritation. For example, I had one reader who started with a 70% gel on the face and contacted me about a reaction they had (although after the surface layer of skin peeled off, her face underneath did look much younger).

Additionally, one tricky aspect of dosing DMSO is that it weighs slightly more than water (1 mL of DMSO is 1.1004 grams). Since DMSO has a fairly wide range of tolerability, I’ve bypassed that issue by treating it as having the same density as water and suggesting a slightly lower oral dose.

Note: when DMSO is taken orally, the total concentration should always be kept to 20% or less, and ideally, it should be administered slowly after eating a meal.

When applying DMSO topically, there are two options. The first is to use a liquid that you directly apply (e.g., I like to use paintbrushes made from natural hairs to dab it on, but sometimes when needed, I just dip my finger in it and then rub it onto the target area, whereas the DMSO field often used sprays for sensitive skin conditions). The second is to use a gel which is rubbed into the skin.

I personally prefer the liquids because it’s easier to control the total dose with them, more gets into the body, and liquid DMSO tends to be less irritating. That said, gels hold the advantage of continually releasing DMSO into the body over a prolonged period and are much easier to apply. As a result, the choice you make is largely a matter of personal preference.

Note: as mentioned above, when applying DMSO topically, it is essential first to clean the area to which it will be used.

Lastly, since many readers have requested it, this is a general guideline on what doses of DMSO tend to be appropriate for each part of the body:

## Internal Use (Oral):

Starting Dose: 1-2 teaspoons in an 8 ounce (or greater) glass of water.

Increase: Up to 6 teaspoons (~18 ml) twice daily for treatment.

Body Weight-Based: 0.05-0.1 g/kg/day (e.g., 7 g for 70 kg, ~2.5 teaspoons), with higher doses (typically up to 2 g/kg) for emergencies (e.g., heart attack or cancer).

Note: as DMSO has an unpleasant taste, it is frequently consumed with juice and away from meals.

## External Use (Skin):

Concentrations:

Legs/Feet: 50–80% (70% typical).

Arms/Torso/Neck: 40–70% (50% typical).

Head/Face: 25–35%. (some go up to 50% for the head)

Wounds: 40–60%.

Warts/Boils: 75%.

Sensitive Skin: Start at 30%.

Application: 2–3 times daily, adjusted based on skin sensitivity and response.

Precautions: Avoid >15% on surgical stitches to prevent brittleness.

Mucous Membranes:

Mouthwash: 5–15% solution, swish for 2–4 minutes (can go higher if no dental implants).

Ear/Nose Drops: 15–40% (15% minimizes irritation).

Other (e.g., oral, rectal, vaginal): As low as 10% due to high tissue permeability.

Gum issues/inflammations: Use 5–15% mouthwash.

Aphthous ulcers/cold sores: Dab directly (often with 100% DMSO).

Injections:

Concentration: 15% for subcutaneous, intraarticular, and intraperitoneal.

Intramuscular/Intravenous: 3-25% in an isotonic solution (discussed further here—we tend to use 3-5%, while 7.5% is frequently recommended; most published studies, particularly in acute emergencies, use higher doses).

Eyes: 3% isotonic solution (although many go up to 40%).

Nebulizer: 1% isotonic solution (although some go much higher and others go much lower).

Additionally, when DMSO goes on a more sensitive part of the body (particularly a mucus membrane such as the eyes, colon, oral mucosa, or lungs) it is often quite helpful to dilute it with an isotonic solution so that it does not create osmotic injury to the applied area (although many do not do this and are fine).

Presently, some of the most popular (and beneficial) DMSO dilution agents that have been identified include:

• Isotonic, 0.9% saline (which can be prepared at home and is widely available).

•Nano-filtered deep-sea seawater (from cleaner regions of the ocean) is one of the most popular options as it contains many essential minerals, including those which support cellular transport, a key facet of DMSO’s therapeutic mechanisms. Typically, either isotonic formulations are purchased, or it is diluted to one-third of its concentration (by mixing it with two parts of purified water).
Note: there is a long history of isotonic seawater being healing and numerous brands of it on the market (e.g., Quinton’s is one of the best).

•12% magnesium chloride

## Respiratory Protocols
From reviewing all the existing DMSO information, it appears that:

Asthma frequently responds to topical DMSO (often 30-60% and sometimes diluted with 12% MgCl2) applied to the front (and, if possible, the back—which can be accomplished alone with a spray bottle) of the lungs, orally, or nebulized DMSO. Most of my readers have achieved success without nebulizing it, but the German community frequently does so and reports significant results from this approach. Finally, one reader who has treated his asthma with topical DMSO shared that the best relief comes from applying it in the morning after a shower and at night before going to bed.
Note: one common asthma protocol involves nebulizing 5-10 drops of DMSO in a 20 ml saline solution. Additionally, in some cases, people find that mixing topical DMSO with a small amount of eucalyptus oil is quite helpful for alleviating asthma symptoms. Finally, for many lung protocols, diluting DMSO with 12% magnesium chloride (which relaxes muscles) can be more effective than DMSO alone.

Seasonal allergies and inflamed nasal mucosa often respond to (15%) nasal drops (which is often diluted with 12% MgCl2 and sometimes include 1% hydrogen peroxide).

Pulmonary fibrosis appears to respond best to high oral DMSO doses (e.g., 3 teaspoons diluted in water, 1-2 times a day), but there are also numerous reports of topical or nebulized DMSO being beneficial.

COPD responds best to nebulized DMSO. However, it also responds to the other options (topical and oral).

Pneumonia and lung infections require nebulized DMSO, preferably mixed with an antimicrobial agent, of which chlorine dioxide is the most preferred, followed by colloidal silver and hydrogen peroxide. When using either CDS or hydrogen peroxide, as they slowly oxidize DMSO (and get reduced in the process), it is important to prepare them immediately prior to application. When using colloidal silver, it is essential to use a true colloid (one that does not contain small silver particulates), as these particulates (e.g., from homemade colloidal silver or a mediocre brand) can gradually deposit in the airways. For this reason, I typically recommend Argentyn 23 for anyone wishing to nebulize colloidal silver.

Note: nebulized CDS and hydrogen peroxide combinations (e.g., 20-40 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide in 20 ml saline) will be discussed further in the next DMSO article I am working on.

Additionally, these principles can be applied for many other areas:

Placed 1 drop of DMSO, 1 drop of Chlorine Dioxide in colloidal silver as carrier into a portable nebulizer (from Amazon) for this gnarly annoying tickle cough. So far it’s feeling I may be onto something.

## Nebulizing DMSO
I have seen a very wide range of concentrations people use to nebulize DMSO (e.g., a few drops in a nebulizer, 1%, 5-10%, 50%, or sometimes higher). All of these have worked for people, however I believe there are greater risks with higher DMSO concentrations than are seen in other modes of application, so it is essential to start at lower concentrations and gradually increase them and never go above 50%.
Note: the community I feel is the most knowledgeable about DMSO advocates for 1% nebulization (and often just has a few drops in the nebulizer), whereas some DMSO authors suggest higher concentrations (e.g., 5-10%).

With DMSO and nebulizing, there are a few key considerations.

First, many nebulizers are made of easily dissolvable plastic. For this reason, you will likely have one that cannot tolerate higher DMSO concentrations, and a few readers have reported discovering that DMSO dissolved their nebulizer’s plastic. As such, this again suggests the use of low concentrations. Fortunately, the concentrations used for nebulization (e.g., 1%) are far below those that leach (typically 15-20%).
Note: if you pre-wash a plastic container with DMSO, it will often remove the easily extractable (and somewhat toxic) chemicals from the plastic’s surface, making subsequent DMSO applications less likely to leach those chemicals.

Second, if a too high DMSO concentration is used, the lungs will “burn.”

Third, ideally when nebulizing, DMSO should be dissolved in an isotonic solution. Of these, the previously mentioned salt water has been the most popular option.

Fourth, some also find that nebulizing dilute CDS, hydrogen peroxide, or colloidal silver very helpful (e.g., particularly when they also have a concurrent infection). I have read many reports of these combined with DMSO creating miraculous cures for conditions like Asthma or COPD, but it is not clear to me from reviewing them if DMSO alone would have also worked. When this is done for non-infectious conditions, it’s often advised to alternate between one and the other.

Fifth, a theoretical risk exists for DMSO (especially over 10%) interfering with the surfactant coating the inside of the lungs (hence causing them to collapse and putting a patient into respiratory distress). This has never been shown to happen (either in anecdotal reports or any data—rather nebulized DMSO treated ARDS). However, for this reason, especially in individuals with compromised respiratory function, it is advisable to go slowly and monitor one’s respiratory capacity during the process (e.g., for chest tightening, reduced spirometry function, or with a pulse oximeter). For this reason, some DMSO authors prefer nasal sprays which do not reach the lungs.
Note: after publishing this, a colleague shared a case with me where it happened that he theorized was a result of the individual (being tall and thin) being at high risk for a pneumothorax.

I think it’s more likely than not this is not an issue, particularly since there are a lot of reports on alternative health forums of remarkable results with 1-5% nebulized DMSO (e.g., for COPD, pneumonia, bronchitis, reducing lung inflammation, clearing mucus, and removing microbial infections), and I’ve not come across any adverse ones), but given that one of the more knowledgeable authors I’ve followed emphasized the risk, I feel obligated to repeat it.

Note: as I have shown, data exists that demonstrates nebulizing DMSO can be quite beneficial to the lungs. In contrast, a rabbit study found that inhaling 25-50 ml/hr of DMSO for an hour each day for 8 weeks caused pathologic changes in the liver and lungs. While this was a high dose and may have been a rabbit specific issue, nebulizing DMSO has nonetheless often been advised against in the DMSO field (which I believe was due to that rabbit study). The best conclusion I can draw from these conflicting data points is that DMSO should be nebulized at low doses.

## Nebulized Glutathione
My California colleague found nebulized glutathione needed to be dosed between 50mg to 200mg a few times per day for each patient experiencing wildfire toxicity.

•Many that offer nebulized glutathione use the same (widely available) glutathione that many compounding pharmacies provide for intravenous injection since that was what they had on hand. However, compounding pharmacies also provide preparation of glutathione meant for nebulization.

Note: if you do this route, please make sure the glutathione is not preserved with aluminum (as it is terrible for zeta potential).

•There are also a few options for purchasing preservative free glutathione that can be nebulized. Of these, I believe the one produced by Thera Naturals is the best option. Unfortunately, while it can be purchased on other websites (Google Reduced L-Glutathione Plus), Thera Naturals is currently out of stock due to the increased demand and hence needs to be contacted for it to be backordered (which I encourage you to do so they increase their supply).

## Other Natural Respiratory Therapies
Over the years, I’ve seen a lot other therapies help alleviate respiratory conditions. In many cases, increasing the mobility of the lungs (e.g., through full-body breathing exercises or bodywork that improves rib cage mobility) can significantly enhance their function. Additionally, many of the natural treatments for autoimmune disorders such as removing allergens from the diet or reducing stress (which I discussed along with reviewing many other natural approaches here) can often be immensely helpful for airway conditions, particularly asthma.

For example, in many cases, over the years, we’ve run into numerous children with asthma who had very stressful (or traumatic) homes. Once they learned self-coping exercises to reduce their stress, their asthma improved. Likewise, in Chinese Medicine, the lungs are considered the organ associated with grief and sadness, and addressing that emotion (e.g., by expressing it rather than keeping it in) can sometimes significantly improve respiratory conditions.

Additionally, in many cases, asthma is triggered by overt (or silent) reflux irritating the upper airway. This is very easy to treat (discussed here) and should always be considered in asthma cases.

Finally, many of the other approaches I’ve focused on here (e.g., improving the physiologic zeta potential or UVBI) can be quite helpful, particularly since when lung function is impaired it becomes more problematic if less blood can reach the lungs.

## Conclusion
While medicine is never easy, one of my greatest frustrations was again and again seeing patients I knew could be easily helped with an existing “non-standard” therapy, instead be continually run through a pharmaceutical treadmill which often only made them sicker. Worse still, I found my colleagues would typically be quite hostile to considering an alternative therapy regardless of how I tried to present it.

As a result, I feel incredibly blessed that a remarkable confluence of historical events is finally making it possible to bring the forgotten aspects of medicine to the public. If people can achieve miraculous results from easily available treatments that greatly exceed the standard of care, they will share their experiences with others. Especially in the post-pandemic climate we live in, many will listen. I am profoundly grateful to each of you for lending me your support and making this endeavor possible. Thank you.
