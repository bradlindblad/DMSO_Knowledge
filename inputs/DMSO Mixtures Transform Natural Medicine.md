Story at a Glance:

•DMSO is an “umbrella remedy” capable of treating a wide range of challenging ailments due to its combination of therapeutic properties (e.g., reducing inflammation, improving circulation, and reviving dying cells). It also rapidly transports substances dissolved in it through the skin and throughout the body.

•DMSO hence greatly enhances the potency and viability of many pharmaceutical drugs and many approved pharmaceutical preparations contain DMSO. Likewise, “unapproved” combinations have successfully treated challenging illnesses, including antimicrobial resistant infections, chemotherapy resistant cancers, and “incurable” chronic pain.

•These benefits are also seen when DMSO is combined with essential oils, herbs, vitamins, oxidative therapies, minerals, antioxidants, biological metabolites, amino acids, dyes, and detoxification agents. Likewise, many holistic therapies (e.g., acupuncture, meditation, physical therapy, hypnotherapy, and heavy metal detoxification) are greatly enhanced by DMSO.

•Natural DMSO combination therapies are frequently highly restorative and rejuvenating to the body. For example, many cosmetic combinations exist that significantly improve the health and appearance of the body. Others rapidly treat various skin issues, such as acne, eczema, and hair loss. Another restores osteoarthritic joints.

•These combinations also treat many challenging illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome, cancer, a myriad of infections (e.g., Lyme disease or toenail fungus), chronic pain, Down Syndrome, lost smell, vision issues, persistent migraines, COPD, and prostate or thyroid issues.

•This article will review the known DMSO combinations and their accompanying body of literature, how they work, and how to prepare and administer each one.Through doing so, I hope to empower you to create your own natural DMSO combinations, as this is one of the most viable paths available for truly “taking control of your own health.”

Over the last year, I’ve worked to bring the public’s attention to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) a forgotten natural therapy which rapidly treats a wide range of conditions and that many studies have shown is very safe (provided it’s used correctly), and, most importantly (thanks to the 1994 DSHEA act which legalized all natural therapies) is now readily available.

Since I believe DMSO has immense potential to offer the medical community and individual patients, I’ve diligently worked to compile evidence that best supports its rediscovery. As such, throughout this series, I’ve presented over a thousand studies that DMSO effectively treats:

Strokes, paralysis, a wide range of neurological disorders (e.g., Down Syndrome and dementia), and many circulatory disorders (e.g., Raynaud’s, varicose veins, hemorrhoids), which I discussed here.

A wide range of tissue injuries, such as sprains, concussions, burns, surgical incisions, and spinal cord injuries (discussed here).

Chronic pain (e.g., from a bad disc, bursitis, arthritis, or complex regional pain syndrome), which I discussed here.

A wide range of autoimmune, protein, and contractile disorders, such as scleroderma, amyloidosis, and interstitial cystitis (discussed here).

A variety of head conditions, such as tinnitus, vision loss, dental problems, and sinusitis (discussed here).

A wide range of internal organ diseases, such as pancreatitis, infertility, liver cirrhosis, and endometriosis (discussed here).

A wide range of skin conditions, such as burns, varicose veins, acne, hair loss, ulcers, skin cancer, and many autoimmune dermatologic diseases (discussed here).

Many challenging infectious conditions, including chronic bacterial infections, herpes, and shingles (discussed here).

Many aspects of cancer (e.g., many of cancer’s debilitating symptoms, making cancer treatments more potent, greatly reducing the toxicity of conventional therapies, and turning cancer cells back into normal cells), which I discussed here.

Many lung disorders, including asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis (discussed here).

Sadly, most of us have never heard about it because the FDA spent decades fighting an unconscionable battle to outlaw and erase DMSO from history. While unbelievable, consider for a moment this 1980 report by 60 Minutes that corroborates much of that:


DMSO Combination Therapies
DMSO’s ability to treat a wide range of illnesses results from its having a variety of highly unusual properties that appear to address the root causes of disease. At the same time however, since DMSO has so many different therapeutic mechanisms (e.g., increasing parasympathetic activity, increasing circulation, regenerating senescent cells, being highly anti-inflammatory, blocking pain conduction etc.), despite having now reviewed thousands of studies on it, there is still a great deal I do not understand about the substance.

This is particularly true for one of DMSO’s most noteworthy properties, its ability to enhance the effects of other substances, which in many cases makes it possible to surmount major dilemmas traditionally seen with those therapies. This is particularly important, as while DMSO helps the majority of recipients (e.g., around 85-90% of readers reported relief from chronic pain), in many instances where DMSO alone will not suffice to address an ailment (e.g., pain), a combination therapy will.

Note: in some cases, the lack of efficacy comes from an incorrect method of administration of DMSO (as some applications are more potent for certain types of issues) or using poor quality DMSO.

DMSO’s unique ability to function as a vehicle is due to the fact that it can pass through biological membranes without damaging them, so once it contacts the skin, it rapidly spreads throughout the body, while simultaneously it readily dissolves most substances and is able to bring them with it into the body.
Note: DMSO also significantly increases fluid circulation throughout the body (including in and out of cells), further enhancing its ability to spread what it carries throughout the body.

This is very useful as:

•Be able to apply a medication topically or orally that would typically require an IV or injection.

•Making drugs become much more potent and able to treat conditions that the illnesses otherwise will not respond to (e.g., these mixtures can penetrate and treat antibiotic resistant bacteria or chemotherapy resistant cancers).

•Allowing lower doses of a drug to be used, which are often much less toxic (as you no longer need to flood the body with it to ensure a high enough concentration is reached in the target area—especially if that area has chronically poor blood flow).

•In many cases, counteract the toxicity of the blended medication (as DMSO protects tissue from injury).

•In some cases, there is a potent synergy between two substances that creates a medical breakthrough (e.g., when DMSO is combined with the pathology dye hematoxylin, it becomes a highly potent cancer therapy which does not affect normal cells).

Note: while DMSO cannot be patented, combinations can. As such, while DMSO alone is “unsafe” “ineffective” and “unproven” many “safe and effective” DMSO pharmaceutical combinations exist, including many approved by the FDA.

In turn, virtually all the previous applies to natural therapies as well, and in many cases DMSO is able to solve major challenges with the treatment or dramatically increase its potency and efficacy. Unfortunately, in many cases, it’s hard to say how much of the benefit comes from DMSO vs. what’s added to it, as many of the benefits I see from combination therapies are similar to what DMSO alone could do. Likewise, at this point, we’ve only barely touched the surface of what can be combined with DMSO, and I am relatively certain many more combinations like DMSO and hematoxylin are waiting to be discovered, which have paradigm shifting therapeutic synergies.

Given all of this, there are a few critical points to understand about natural DMSO combination therapies:

•In many cases where DMSO alone does not work for a condition (which DMSO is known to improve), a combination therapy will. For example, yesterday I learned someone I had been suffering from a severe migraine where DMSO didn’t work for her (which for others, it often does), so shortly before going to the ER, she decided to mix DMSO with two botanicals, responded immediately, and within an hour, her three-day migraine was over (which was life-changing for her).

•Many have found that combining DMSO with their favorite natural therapies has allowed them to take medical care into their own hands and “be their own doctor.”

•While DMSO combination therapies are generally safe, there are a variety of risks and safety considerations that need to be taken into consideration, particularly once one begins experimenting with them. It is for this reason that in the previous article, I listed a variety of critical rules to understand when creating your own combination therapies. As such, if you decide to explore creating therapeutic DMSO combinations, you need to read the previous article first (available here).

•While DMSO has a variety of positive pharmaceutical synergies, it appears to work best when combined with natural therapies. Additionally, as natural substances tend to be less toxic than pharmaceuticals, you are much less likely to run into a complication from potentiating a medication (but nonetheless, you should still read the previous article). That said, it is still essential to make sure you use high-quality products to avoid the risk of low-quality ones, which have toxic additives or contaminants in them, and likewise to avoid substances that are known to be toxic or (once filtered and sterile) never appropriate to infuse.

•Much like conventional therapies, many DMSO combinations remain undiscovered, and simultaneously, some of the combinations I’ve seen promoted are likely unnecessary (as DMSO alone would have the same effect).

Additionally, in many cases, natural alternatives to cosmetics can be made by combining pure fats, oils, or herbal extracts with DMSO, which is often quite advantageous, as beyond being quite effective, they avoid the toxicity, reactions, and dehydration of the skin or mucus membranes commonly seen with standard cosmetics.

Natural Combination Studies
Since DMSO has so much value as a pharmaceutical vehicle, a large volume of scientific literature exists on DMSO being used in combination with pharmaceutical drugs, and many different approved formulations exist (highlighting the absurdity of our medical bureaucracy, as alone, DMSO is “dangerous and unproven” but when combined with other patentable agents “safe and effective”).

As such, I covered that body of literature in the previous article, both to show, contrary to popular belief, that DMSO is widely used in medicine (provided money can be made), and so readers considering combination therapies could gain critical insights into how DMSO combinations interact with the body.

Beyond pharmaceuticals, many approved DMSO products also incorporate natural agents such as dexpanthenol (a form of B5 used for wound healing), menthol, camphor, lavandin, lavender oil, coriander oil, arnica, potassium iodide, or capsicum. In turn, a significant number of studies exist throughout the literature on using natural DMSO combination therapies, which I will now cover (excluding ones where heparin was used, as they are covered in the previous article, which details the majority of the DMSO combination studies).

Note: unless otherwise specified, all DMSO treatments were done topically (frequently with a DMSO containing ointment).

Chinese Herbs
A significant amount of DMSO research has been done in China, which has naturally led to studying it in combination with traditional Chinese Herbs, where together, they have been found to help a wide range of conditions:

•In rats with Alzheimer’s disease, DMSO and Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE), administered for 14 days, improved learning and memory by reducing escape latency and searching distance in a water maze test.

•In 33 patients with severe psoriasis (25 with psoriasis vulgaris 7 with psoriasis guttate 1 with psoriasis pustulosa) found that an extract of camptotheca nuts dissolved in 70% DMSO was a "quick, effective and convenient treatment," as a year later, 21 had a complete resolution of the disease, while the remaining 12 had greatly improved (but a few eruptions still could be found along with discolored patches of skin, especially on the lower legs where lesions had previously been reported).

•In 31 patients with postherpetic neuralgia, DMSO and a Chinese herbal medicine reduced pain scores and improved symptoms more effectively than standard medical therapy.

•A hospital dermatology department reported that DMSO and 0.05% lithospermum (purple gromwell) effectively treated viral warts.

•In mice with cervical carcinoma, treatment with 50 mg/kg DMSO combined with 20 mg/kg Zhenhuang injection extended survival by 65.81%–69.83% in ascitic tumors and inhibited solid tumor growth by 60.83%–68.33%, significantly outperforming DMSO alone (21.37%–25.86% survival, 22.50%–25.83% inhibition) or Zhenhuang alone (41.38%–43.59% survival, 37.50%–41.67% inhibition).

•A 15% DMSO, 1% mefenamic acid, and 10% knotweed herb extract ointment, demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in rats by reducing experimentally induced paw edema and having a more prolonged effect over 24 hours than standard care.

•Many studies have shown DMSO enhances the absorption of plant extracts (e.g., for ginseng). In this report, DMSO was found to increase the penetration of traditional ointment (distilled from honeysuckle, dandelion, forsythia, Chinese violet, and salvia miltiorrhiza).

Note: some Chinese formulations combine steroids, DMSO, and borneol (a traditional medicine found in herbs like camphor, rosemary, thyme, ginger, and cannabis).

Vitamins and Nutraceuticals
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has been combined with DMSO to treat a variety of conditions. For example:

•A 2022 randomized trial of 25 patients (with 28 confirmed basal cell cancers), investigators found when 30% ascorbic acid was combined with 95% DMSO and 0.2–0.3 ml was applied topically twice a day (with a cuticle brush), after 8 weeks, 86.7% of the cancers had completely disappeared, whereas in comparison, after 8 weeks of 5% imiquimod (a common topical skin cancer treatment with side effects), only 57.1% had disappeared. Finally, ascorbic acid had fewer adverse effects than imiquimod (the standard treatment).

•One Russian combination therapy for treating trophic ulcers, wounds, burns, scars, and keloids uses 25-50% DMSO in a hyaluronic gel with collagen or MSM, ascorbic acid, and coenzyme Q10,1,2 while a similar preparation, given as a suppository, was developed for rectal fissures. Likewise, another study found DMSO and vitamin C synergistically treated burns.

Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and vitamin E have also been repeatedly used with DMSO to protect tissue from injury. For example, in cases where the blood supply is cut off:

•DMSO, ascorbic acid, glutamine, hydrocortisone succinate and pentoxifylline protected the jejunal (intestinal) lining of horses from its blood supply being temporarily cut off (e.g., there was reduced mucosal erosion and hemorrhage).

•DMSO with alpha lipoic acid or ternatin protected rat testicles from having their blood supply cut off by reducing oxidative stress.

•In rabbits, IV DMSO protected their kidneys from having their blood supply cut off, with an even greater effect seen when N-Acetylcysteine was infused concurrently (e.g., blood markers of kidney damage were reduced and the combined group’s kidneys showed minimal histologic changes).

•In sheep, two studies found that DMSO protected sheep from otherwise fatal smoke inhalation injuries, that this effect was enhanced by combining it with N-acetylcysteine or heparin, and that DMSO alone was more effective than either of those two therapies (which alone also helped).1,2

Likewise, in rats with ARDS (a lung condition that frequently places patients on ventilators):

•Intraperitoneal DMSO maintained blood oxygen levels and superoxide dismutase activity reduced plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and reduced plasma protein and red blood cell leakage into the lungs and significantly protected the capillary alveolar lining. When vitamin E was given as well, lung injury further decreased and lung fluid accumulation was also reduced (evidenced by a reduced wet lung-to-body weight ratio). Other rat studies have also shown DMSO and vitamin E protect the lungs and reduce the severity of ARDS.1,2

•Additionally, another ARDS study found DMSO combined with ginsenosides (from ginseng) prevented lung damage and prevented fluid leakage into the lungs.

Note: DMSO’s ability to reduce chronic pulmonary fibrosis was enhanced by zinc.

Certain chemotherapies will significantly injure tissue if they leak out of the vein (extravasate) into which they are being infused, and many studies show how DMSO effectively treats these injuries.

In both animal and human studies, success has also been obtained from topical DMSO combined with an active form of vitamin E (e.g., in a study of 8 patients and another of 10, it prevented the expected ulceration and tissue death following the extravasation)1,2,3,4 Likewise, in another study, DMSO’s ability to protect rat brains from FeCl₂ injections was enhanced by the active form of vitamin E (demonstrated by reduced lipid peroxidation and an accelerated resolution of brain edema).

Note: DMSO has also been shown to affect the antioxidant capacity of bioflavonoids1,2 and to enhance the ability of lysozyme to bind with plant flavonoid compounds.

These combinations also protect from other types of environmental injuries:

•In mice, DMSO and vitamin E protected them from free radical damage due to radiation exposure, with DMSO being more protective than vitamin E, and the combination more protective than either alone.1,2
Note: another study found DMSO with Trasylol and epsilon-aminocaproic acid prevented radiation injuries, while a third found DMSO and CoQ10 healed them.

•A mixture of DMSO and tea polyphenols protected bronchial (airway) cells from genetic damage following cigarette smoke exposure or uranium dust exposure.1,2

Finally, a 1983 study (and a 1978 study) showed the increase in blood flow DMSO created for scleroderma patients (which is quite significant) was even greater when it was mixed with the antispasmodic drotaverine and much greater in the skin (but not muscles) when mixed with niacin (vitamin B3).


Another study of 65 patients found DMSO mixed with B3 applied to the affected part of the face as a compress 10-12 times and was shown to provide a statistically significant improvement in the number cured and the duration of therapy they required.

Note: a study on the solvation of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) in water–DMSO mixtures found that higher DMSO concentrations reduce hydrogen bonding and enhance conjugation, likely increasing its lipophilicity and topical bioavailability. Another study found DMSO reduced nicotinamide hydrogen bonding and increased conjugation—likely increasing its membrane permeability (and thus the efficacy of topical applications).

Additionally, curcumin (an effective anti-inflammatory therapy which has absorption challenges) is a potent combination with DMSO and studies have assessed the molecular interactions of the two.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

Iodine
As iodine has antimicrobial properties and is essential for the body, a variety of papers have explored using DMSO to bring forms of it into target areas such as:

•In 58 patients, negative pressure wound therapy using DMSO and povidone (PVP) iodine was found to be an effective therapy for chronic purulent wounds, trophic ulcers with atherosclerotic lesions of the vessels of the extremities, and diabetic angiopathy.1,2

•A case report, where a 95-year-old female with chronic Demodex (mite) eyelid inflammation received topical 0.25% PVP iodine in a DMSO gel. Unlike previous therapies, this treated her infection.

•DMSO with iodopyron has been found effective against a pseudomonas aeruginosa (a bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotic therapies).

•Topical DMSO and PVP-I, without side effects, have successfully treated molluscum contagiosum (e.g., in the groin of a 14-month old boy and a 63-year old man), making it a promising treatment for the condition.

•In 121 patients with rheumatic pain, treatment combining infrared irradiation with topical application of 20% “681” (defined as a halogen alkali and most likely potassium iodide) and DMSO reduced pain and inflammation, improving symptoms.

•An economical DMSO, silver ion, and iodine formulation was created, which had high potency against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In livestock, it had a 90-95% success rate in treating purulent-septic diseases, hoof damage, and mastitis (where it did not impair milk production and had no toxicity).
Note: at a Chinese hospital, a tincture of iodine was formulated using DMSO as a solvent, which replaced or reduced the traditional use of potassium iodide.

Lastly, one reader shared:

I've been using DMSO with 2% povidine iodine (Betadine) for months with great success. Heals diabetic leg ulcers, toenail fungus, and even seems to help with skin cancers.

Other Natural Antimicrobials
A variety of other natural agents, such as vinegar, silver particles, and antimicrobial enzymes, have also shown promise when combined with DMSO.

•A 2023 clinical trial gave an oral DMSO spray containing zinc iodide, ginger extract, propolis extract, and xylitol to patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. Compared to placebo, this treatment caused significant improvements in clinical symptoms, recovery time, and viral clearance.

•Another study found DMSO with propolis had antimicrobial activity against the microbes causing otitis externa in dogs.

•DMSO mixed with a variety of different plant extracts was highly effective at inhibiting the growth of Candida infections isolated from patients with mouth cancers (whereas it was resistant to many anti-fungals).

•DMSO with food grade vinegar was found to be an effective treatment for 406 patients with fungal athlete’s foot (59% DMSO 41% vinegar given 3-4 times a day for 3-5 days) and 100 patients with jock itch (40% DMSO 60% vinegar).

•DMSO with lidase was found to be a highly effective treatment for actinomycosis of the face and neck.

•DMSO combined with a nuclease treated meningitis or meningoencephalitis caused by an acute viral respiratory infection.

•DMSO with papaya enzyme and nitrofurazone was found to treat suppurative wounds. DMSO in conjunction with electrophoresis was also used to transport papaya enzyme.

•5-10% DMSO and silver nanoparticles was found to be an effective treatment for serous mastitis in cows.

•DMSO with silver ions was found to improve the healing of infected wounds.

•When calcium hydroxide and DMSO were combined, there was a 5.7 increase in their antimicrobial potency against E. faecalis.

•In animals, 10% DMSO combined with the fungus Duddingtonia flagrans and 1.87% ivermectin effectively treated parasitic ear inflammation caused by Rhabditis spp.

•Bacteriophages are sometimes used to treat bacterial infections. In one study, low doses of DMSO were shown to increase bacteriophage RNA replication.

Additionally, DMSO significantly increased the ability of Annona muricata seed extracts to eliminate mosquitos in the water and after 6 hours, 0.5mg/L killed 62% of larva and 100% of pupae.

Natural Dental Treatments
In dentistry, DMSO reduces inflammation within teeth (pulpitis) and gums (periodontitis), helps eliminate the bacteria causing that inflammation, improves blood flow to teeth, and assists with healing teeth. Because of this, many therapeutic combinations have been developed to use it to treat pulpitis (e.g., with antibiotics) and improve the healing of teeth. Many natural substances have also been used for this:

•50% DMSO and 1 mg/ml oleanolic acid (which is found in many plants including olives) in 30 extracted human teeth with enterococcus faecalis infections rapidly reduced bacteria levels, within 24 hours completely eliminating them, with the combination being more potent than either alone.1,2,3

•DMSO, alone or combined with lysozyme (an antimicrobial activity), effectively treated acute serous limited pulpitis in 95.6% of 120 teeth immediately after treatment, with 93.1% success at 3 months and 82.9% at 24 months, and chronic fibrous pulpitis in 89.3% of 28 teeth immediately, though success dropped to 56.3% at 24 months, showing strong short-term pain relief and inflammation control in dental pulpitis.

•In patients with deep caries and early pulpitis, a 20% DMSO and calcium hydroxide combination used as a pulp-capping treatment significantly reduced inflammation and improved outcomes compared to traditional methods, simplifying the procedure and enhancing short-term effectiveness.

•In 60 patients with localized inflammatory pulpitis, 20% DMSO and calcium hydroxide for pulp capping effectively treated the condition.

•DMSO in a gel with 10% glucosamine hydrochloride, nettle juice, and Kalanchoe juice effectively treated periodontitis in animals, reducing inflammation and speeding tissue repair.

•15% DMSO mixed with a herbal extract treated periodontal disease.

•In 20 patients with generalized periodontitis, using electrical currents to direct DMSO, metronidazole, and sodium alginate to the gums improved periodontal health by reducing inflammation indices by 40% immediately and 20% at 6 months, extending remission by 30% compared to the electrical current alone.

•Over two years at Yangzhou People's Hospital, a compound hydroxyapatite paste combined with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and various pharmaceuticals was used for pulp capping in patients with pulp hyperemia or chronic pulpitis. It effectively reduced tooth sensitivity and promoted pulp preservation in cases with cavities sensitive to cold/heat, pinpoint pulp exposure, or extreme probe sensitivity without spontaneous pain. Identical results were reported in another study. Finally, a third study reported DMSO with calcium hydroxide was an effective pulp capping agent that gradually healed the pulp tissue.

•In extracted human third molars, a solution of 50% DMSO combined with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) at 0.01–1% concentrations improved long-term dentin bonding stability compared to distilled water or DMSO alone; DMSO likely enhances EGCG penetration through dentin cell membranes to strengthen bonding durability.

Other Head Conditions:
•DMSO plus short-acting insulin and 5% calcium pantothenate (B5) safely treated 42 patients ages 23 to 62 with chronic parenchymatous parotitis. Likewise, another study also found DMSO and insulin treated this condition.

•Sjogren's syndrome is quite difficult to treat. In one study, DMSO alone provided significant improvement which was further enhanced by vitamin C.


•A variety of DMSO applications improve tinnitus. In one study, a combination spray containing circulation promoting agents like capsicum (and lidocaine) treated tinnitus

Wound Healing
•In mice with second-degree burn wounds, DMSO, collagen, and dextran accelerated healing and reduced inflammation.

•DMSO mixed with linetol (a flaxseed concentrate with anti-inflammatory, regenerative, and wound-healing properties) treated burns.

•Alone, a Brazilian green propolis improved surgical wound healing (and reduced inflammation) by 40%, while in combination with DMSO, improved it by 50%, along with eliminating the need for antibiotics or inflammatory medications.

•In rats where part of the colon had been removed (requiring each remaining end to be surgically stitched together), a DMSO quercetin mixture given intraperitoneally post surgery significantly improved healing (e.g., the maximum strength of the sutured tissue along with hydroxyproline, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and catalyze levels had a 1.4-3.9 fold improvement).

•A Russian suppository containing (50%) DMSO and hyaluronic acid (along with vitamin C, collagen, and coenzyme Q10) was developed to treat rectal fissures, while another (25% DMSO in a hyaluronic gel with MSM, collagen, vitamin C, and coenzyme Q10) was made to heal wounds, ulcers, burns, scars, keloids or similar diseases.

Energy Combinations
DMSO delivered with electrical currents has treated a variety of disorders such as:

•Pyelonephritis in children
•Healing duodenal ulcers (sometimes in combination with humisol or electrophoresis) and improving gastric acid secretion.1,2,3,4,5
•In women with repeated miscarriage and chlamydia cervicitis, in combination with chymotrypsin, magnetic laser therapy, and vibroaspiration, it increased successful pregnancy outcomes by 16.3% compared to standard treatment.
•In 85 children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, when combined with magnetotherapy, effectively reduced pain and morning stiffness.
•Gastrointestinal diseases in metal industry workers (when used in combination with vitamin E).

Additionally, DMSO, combined with Dynamic Electro-Neuro Stimulation therapy, effectively treated tendinitis in sport horses, reducing inflammation (e.g., inflammatory markers were reduced by 33.8–68.0%) and promoting tissue repair for faster recovery.1,2

Lastly, ultrasound, heated mud, and acupuncture have also been combined with DMSO for a variety of musculoskeletal disorders:

•In rats, DMSO and gold nanoparticles directed by pulsed therapeutic ultrasound treated experimentally induced muscle injury (e.g., muscle injury markers decreased and antioxidant capacity increased).

•Cervical osteochondrosis, a degenerative condition causing neck pain and stiffness due to spinal disc and joint deterioration, is sometimes treated with heated therapeutic mud (due to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and muscle-relaxing properties). A 1989 study with 58 participants found applying 25% DMSO beforehand significantly enhanced this therapy, with the response rate going from 50% after 10 applications to 100% after 5-6 applications, with improvement being objectively measured through cervical x-rays, skin thermometry, muscle algotensiometry, and hand dynamometry.

•DMSO with low intensity microwave therapy and therapeutic mud applications was found to effectively treat osteoarthritis, reducing inflammation and improving joint function in patients.

•In patients with ankle joint sprains from physical exercise, treatment with Dolobene (a DMSO-containing gel) combined with acupuncture achieved a 94% effectiveness rate in reducing pain and swelling, outperforming Dolobene alone (80%) and acupuncture alone (66%), with no significant side effects.

•Finally in numerous studies, DMSO has been shown to enhance the penetration of light into tissue (e.g., this was demonstrated with 5% DMSO applied to pig skin for 60 minutes through Raman spectroscopy and again in pig skin where it reduced optical absorption and scattering coefficients)

Note: healers in many disciplines (e.g., some German physical therapists apply it in areas of pain or inflammation before manual therapy or doing a patient exercise) have reported that DMSO enhances their treatments. Likewise, using DMSO eye drops before eye exercises allows its muscle-relaxing properties to help loosen overstrained or hardened eye muscles, enhancing the effectiveness of exercises to improve eye muscle mobility.

Natural Cancer Combinations
In addition to vitamin C and Chinese herbs, many other natural therapies have been combined with DMSO to treat cancer. For example, many studies have found that infusing it with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is very helpful for reducing cancer symptoms:

•A 2011 study found it significantly benefited patients with metastatic prostate cancer:



•A 2014 study of 9 patients with advanced biliary adenocarcinomas found the same:



•A 2011 study of 26 patients with severe refractory pain from advanced cancers found it was an effective method of pain control that also improved the patient’s quality of life, reduced the side effects of chemotherapy, and possibly increased their length of survival.

DMSO has been extensively shown to suppress cancer growth and cause cancer cells to differentiate (revert back to normal cells). A few studies have assessed this with DMSO combinations:

•Alpha-lipoic acid was found to significantly enhance DMSO’s ability to differentiate mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cells, but not to induce differentiation without DMSO.

•Retinoic acid (a vitamin A metabolite) has also shown promise for inducing cancer differentiation, works synergistically with DMSO1,2,3 and uses a different differentiating pathway than DMSO.1,2

•In human ovarian cancer cells (COC1), DMSO and retinoic acid significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced differentiation.

•A 1969 study found that DMSO, when combined with heat and vitamin A, selectively targeted cancer cells (and facilitated the release of lysosomal enzymes).

•In mice with skin cancer grafts, topical DMSO and vitamin E mixed with cabazitaxel suppressed tumor growth by 50% compared to controls.

•A 2023 study found that fatty acids isolated from the urine of healthy cows and mixed with DMSO was an effective therapy against breast cancer cells.

•A 2018 study found that DMSO and a plant extract selectively arrested cell growth and induced cell death of colon cancer cells.

Lastly, DMSO has been shown to significantly potentiate conventional cancer therapies (and cure challenging cancers). In some cases, these studies also incorporate a natural therapy. For example, a 1975 study of 65 patients with incurable cancers (most of whom had received conventional therapies) found that a low dose of cyclophosphamide mixed in DMSO with GABA, GABOB, and acetylglutamine cured 57 of them.

Other Natural Combinations
•In a 2024 randomized placebo-controlled trial, 62 patients with plantar fasciitis applied a topical solution of phytoterpenes (10% camphor, 5% menthol, 5% eugenol, 2% eucalyptol, 3% vanillin) with 15% DMSO, 1% limonene, and rosemary oil as penetration enhancers twice daily for 10 days. This caused an 85% or greater reduction in pain scores in 78.1% of patients whereas no improvement was seen in the placebo group.

•A 2021 study found DMSO combined with ginsenosides, particularly CK, exhibited significant therapeutic effects on rheumatoid arthritis. In cell studies, it potently inhibited the proliferation of LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages and TNF-α-induced HUVEC endothelial cells, while promoting their apoptosis, thus reducing inflammation and pannus formation. In collagen-induced arthritis mice, CK substantially alleviated joint swelling, redness, and functional impairment, preserved joint structure, and reduced proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Additionally, CK modulated the immune response by increasing CD8+ T cells and decreasing activated CD4+ T cells and M1-macrophages, with low toxicity to major organs, positioning it as a promising candidate for RA treatment.

•DMSO is commonly combined with magnesium chloride for wounds, injuries and pain. One Russian study, in turn, used DMSO combined with a commercial magnesium oitment.

•In rabbits, DMSO protects heart tissue that has lost its blood supply from dying, and this protection was enhanced with the simultaneous administration of hydrogen peroxide. In devascularized skin flaps, DMSO alone prevented carbon dioxide levels from increasing, while hydrogen peroxide was added, tissue oxygen levels then increased.

•A 1980 study gave 129 newborns with epiphysial and meta-epiphysial osteomyelitis DMSO and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which improved their general condition, normalized serum laboratory values, reduced bone destruction, and accelerated bone regeneration. Identical results were achieved in a 1978 study of acute and chronic osteomyelitis, a 1979 study of 43 children with chronic osteomyelitis, and a 1981 study of 54 children with acute septic osteomyelitis (where reduced tissue edema was also seen).

•In 38 patients with strong body odors, in addition to a DMSO aluminum chloride combination, 40% urea in 70% DMSO solution effectively reduced underarm odor.
Note: individuals have also reported using DMSO (alone) as a highly effective deodorant.

•D-limonene combined with DMSO, sequentially instilled into the gallbladders of New Zealand rabbits with implanted human gallstones, dissolved stones more effectively than either D-limonene or DMSO alone after 72 hours.

•In 96 patients aged 51–89 with benign prostatic hyperplasia, DMSO suppositories containing 30 mg prostatilen [prostate peptide] relieved infravesical obstruction symptoms, improving voiding disorders in those with initial or moderate symptoms.
Note: 10% DMSO was repeatedly found to enhance the penetration of another peptide (TAT) into cells, allowing better cellular distribution of it in the cytosol and nucleus.1,2

Lastly, in pinto beans, 0.01% DMSO was observed to effectively protect them from ozone injury, particularly at levels above 800 μg/m³ — which is highly relevant since DMSO is often combined with ozone or other oxidative therapies.

Healing with Natural DMSO Combinations
Despite having gone through over 10,000 studies on DMSO, there is still a great deal I do not understand about the substance, as much remains to be researched; many things have not been extensively explored. This in turn is particularly true for the natural therapeutic combinations, as while I listed quite a few of them in the previous section (which comprise every one I have thus far identified), there are hundreds if not thousands of natural therapies, each of which could be tested in for dozens of things in the body, hence making it impossible most will ever be extensively researched.

Fortunately, the safety and efficacy of DMSO have inspired a large do-it-yourself community, particularly within Germany. As a result, many different combinations have been extensively explored, which have been successfully used to treat a wide range of conditions.

As many of those conditions are ones that DMSO alone has been shown to treat or improve, when I reviewed the reports and accompanying literature, in about half of the cases, I was not sure if the natural therapy being combined with DMSO provided a benefit or if the same results would have happened without DMSO. Nonetheless, there were also many instances where a clear benefit was seen from the natural agent being added to DMSO.

In turn, while many natural substances could be mixed with DMSO, I know of about 120 that have been primarily focused on, many of which I believe were chosen due to their existing popularity within the natural medicine field, and a smaller number of which were adopted due to their unique synergies with DMSO. They are as follows:

Carrier Oils and Topical Bases — Aloe Vera, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Shea Butter, Beef Tallow, MCT Oil, Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, Beeswax, Sesame Oil

When DMSO is chronically used, it can sometimes dehydrate the skin (due to the skin’s oils being drawn inward). For that reason, many individuals find they have a better response to DMSO within a carrier oil, particularly when making natural cosmetics.

Many of these oils also have a variety of other therapeutic properties, which make them popular to use with DMSO (e.g., for skin, prostate, musculoskeletal, or eye issues, along with wound healing, burns, cataracts, CRPS, Alzheimer’s, and hernias). Likewise in some cases, DMSO improves the functionality and utility of a carrier oil already being used in cosmetics.

Note: DMSO can also be diluted in a variety of substances besides water, each of which has unique therapeutic properties (e.g., healing wounds or treating scars) which allow them to enhance DMSO further.

Essential Oils —Frankincense, Tea Tree, Peppermint, Lavender, Eucalyptus, Myrrh, Black Pepper, Wintergreen, Clary Sage, Sweet Birch, Thyme, Oregano, Rosemary (and various Ayurvedic oils)

Generally, these combinations aim to extenuate the known properties of the oils. Some treat a variety of infections, many are used for musculoskeletal issues and reducing inflammation, others treat a variety of types of pain such as headaches and sciatica, while others improve circulation, parasympathetic tone, anxiety, digestion, and autoimmune conditions like asthma and psoriasis. Additionally, DMSO lowers the amount of the essential oil needed and makes it much easier to treat conditions that affect the skin and underlying tissues (e.g., infections).

Botanicals — Arnica, Comfrey, Turmeric, Black Cumin Seed Oil, Cayenne Pepper, Pansy Tea, Lemon Balm and Lemon Oil, Eyebright, Strophanthus, Hawthorn, CBD Oil, Amygdalin, Witch Hazel, Nettle Hydrolate, Sulforaphane, Black Salve Extract, Horse Chestnut, Ginger, Green Tea Extract, Daisy Tea, Blueberry Extract, Almond Oil, Neem Oil, Passion Flower, Ginkgo

A few of these have remarkable anti-inflammatory properties, are excellent for healing injuries or pain, and frequently are far more effective than standard preparations of the herb. Many also treat a wide variety of skin conditions (including growths like lipomas and seborrheic keratosis), others address visual and cardiovascular, issues (e.g., cataracts), one has been used to treat Parkinson’s, another for hyperthyroidism, another for seizures, a few are used for anxiety and insomnia and many have been used to improve cognition.
Note: many other herbal preparations are also used with DMSO.

Vitamins and Antioxidants — Vitamin C, B12, D, E, K, Glutathione, NAC, MSM, B-complexes, Multivitamins, Alpha-Lipoic-Acid, CoQ10, Superoxide Dismutase

Nutraceuticals are often mixed with DMSO to have greater absorption of them (and increased potency) without requiring them to be injected (e.g., many have remarkable improvements in energy levels from topical DMSO vitamin combinations). In many cases, this has allowed the vitamin to function in a regenerative manner in ways that differ significantly from the standard preparation (e.g., these combinations are frequently used to cure osteoarthritis, hearing loss, loss of smell, and tinnitus) or surmounted a fundamental clinical limitation of the nutraceutical.

Finally, many of these nutraceuticals are used for specific diseases (e.g., prostate enlargement, Parkinson’s, cataracts, glaucoma, COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and a wide variety of stubborn infections throughout the body).

Minerals — Magnesium, Iodine, Colloidal Silver, Selenium, Boron, Zinc, Lithium, Baking Soda, Cesium Chloride

The most common uses for the minerals are musculoskeletal (e.g., healing from injuries, reducing pain, improving wound healing, and muscle relaxation), eliminating infections throughout the body, and treating a variety of glandular issues (e.g., in the thyroid, prostate, and breast). They are also sometimes used for a variety of other diseases (nail fungal overgrowths, protecting the nervous system, improving fatigue, and addressing a variety of joint issues (e.g., arthritis and gout).

Natural Metabolites — Hydroxymethylfurfural, Lactic Acid, Urea, Galactose, Allantoin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Honey, Apple Cider Vinegar, Furfural, Dichloroacetic Acid, Propolis, Humic Acids

Many of these have a remarkable restorative capacity of the body (e.g., many have had success using one to treat Chronic Fatigue Syndrome while others have been repeatedly used to rebuild connective tissue, strengthen blood vessels and revitalize the skin).

Most commonly, they are used for cosmetic applications (e.g., toning skin or eliminating excessive fat) or cancer, but many are also used with DMSO to treat varicose veins, neurodegenerative diseases, lymphedema, scars, insulin resistance, fungal infections, gut dysbiosis, and sleep disorders.
Note: DMSO has been shown to increase the passage of urea and gylcine through blood cell membranes (which the investigators attributed to it altering membrane fluidity) and in another study, the passage of urea, mannitol, urea, sodium, potassium, and chloride through frog skin, and in a third study to enhance the intestinal absorption of glucose and galactose (by allowing them to absorb through diffusion rather than carrier mediated transport—suggesting their fat solubility was increased).

Amino Acids and Neurotransmitters — Essential Amino Acids, GABA, Melatonin, Glutamine, Glycine, Taurine, N-Acetylglutamate, Gamma Amino Beta Hydroxybutyric Acid (GABOB)

Despite the fact that it has been shown in numerous studies,1,2,3 Congressional hearings, and readers here have now replicated those results, the facet of DMSO I still find the most unbelievable is that it can treat the physical and cognitive aspects of Down Syndrome (when used in combination with amino acids). Additionally, those results led to exploring using this combination for developmentally delayed children where it also produced significant improvements.1,2,3,4,5

Many of these can also be used for insomnia, anxiety, neurological health, or eye health, tissue repair, and joint issues in a manner far more potent than each of these substances does alone.

Oxidative Therapies — Hydrogen Peroxide, Chlorine Dioxide (CDS/MMS), Artemisia Annua (Wormwood), Rizol (Ozonated oil blend), Ozonated Water, Potassium Permanganate, Hypochlorous Acid

These are extremely popular for eliminating a wide range of challenging infections (including chronic Lyme disease, EBV and a wide range of dental infections). They are also often used to treat cancer, treat inflammatory skin conditions (e.g., many experience rapid acne relief), eliminate unwanted skin growths, treat post viral conditions (e.g., long COVID) and improve circulation (along with recovery from strokes or heart attacks).

Note: the DMSO doctors I have been corresponding with have all shared they’re continuing to have significant success combining topical DMSO and CDS with oral ivermectin (or just DMSO with topical ivermectin) for treating cancer.

Dyes — Hematoxylin, Rose Bengal, Methylene Blue, Riboflavin

Hematoxylin, a common pathology dye, when combined with DMSO, is one of the most effective (and easily accessible) cancer therapies I have come across.

Rose Bengal is another commonly used (and fairly non-toxic) pathology dye with anti-cancer properties (e.g., against human ovarian and gastric cancer cells,1,2 in mice against melanoma and breast cancer, in two patients with refractory scalp sarcomas, in a phase I trial of 23 refractory melanoma patients and also to enhance the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy).

Recently it was shown to be an effective treatment for melanoma (when injected directly into the cancer), with a 48% response rate (which increased to 69% with higher doses), along with no side effects and overall increased survival. That 11 person trial inspired a 2015 multicenter trial of 62 stage III and 18 stage IV melanoma patients with refractory cutaneous or subcutaneous metastatic melanoma, of whom 51% responded, 26% had a complete response, and 8% were fully cured a year later (along with no significant side effects to treatment).

These excellent results, and their parallels to hematoxylin, inspired the DMSO community to try mixing it with DMSO, and it has been found to be an effective cancer treatment.

Note: lastly, in addition to being used for cancer treatments, each of these dyes are sometimes used to remove other skin lesions, and with DMSO, some significantly improve energy levels and cognitive function.

Chelating and Detoxifying Agents — EDTA, DMSA, DTPA, DMPS, Chlorella, Cilantro, Sodium Thiosulfate, Emeramide Calcium Gluconate Monohydrate, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Bentonite Clay, Activated Charcoal

Since DMSO is able to open minute circulations within the body (e.g., from the cells to the surrounding interstitial fluid), it is able to both increase the ability of chelating agents to access metals deep within the body or within the brain and then to bring those metals into the circulation so they can be eliminated (e.g., DMSO will often increase urination during detoxification protocols). Because of this, DMSO is frequently observed to significantly increase the amount of metals excreted during chelation sessions, while in tandem, due to its free-radical neutralizing and tissue protective qualities, can also mitigate many of the side effects (e.g., detoxification reactions) from excessive toxic metals (or other toxins) entering the system.
Note: DMSO’s metabolite dimethylsulfide has some ability to bind many toxic metals (enabling their excretion through the liver and bile), and one proposed theory for DMSO’s ability to improve autoimmune diseases or neurological disorders relates to its ability to reduce toxic heavy metal burdens (e.g., cases exist of dementia patients with significant metal burdens having their cognition improving from DMSO—and some German doctors now use DMSO chelation protocols to prevent dementia). However, while DMSO has some chelating capacity, its primary role is to enhance the efficacy of other agents by transporting them deeper into the body.

One of the major challenges in integrative medicine is “complex” patients who have numerous debilitating neurologic and autoimmune diseases, as rather than improving from the treatments given to them, often get worse, which results in minute therapeutic doses often being required for the patient to improve, as they are too sensitive to anything else. A variety of opinions exist on what causes patients to enter this state (e.g., I believe it’s strongly linked to an unresolved cell danger response and insufficient zeta potential impairing circulation).

One theory (which has proven itself in clinical practice) is that there is simply too much toxicity in the person’s system, and they do not have the ability to eliminate it. DMSO’s unique capacity to facilitate detoxification (e.g., binding both fat and water-soluble toxins or supporting phase II liver detoxification) is quite compelling. In turn, the experience of the DMSO field has been that DMSO can either trigger or prevent the detoxification reactions seen from chelation, cleanses, and fasts, depending on how it is used, making it potentially an invaluable tool for sensitive patients or typical patients who want to eliminate toxicity from deeper compartments of the body.
Note: when cleanses are done in conjunction with DMSO, there is increased urination, which some believe is due to deeper compartments of the body being detoxified.

Additionally, DMSO makes it possible to do chelation protocols which would normally require IV access at home. Finally, certain DMSO-chelator combinations have been used for more unusual applications (e.g., expelling fluoride, treating skin calcinosis, treating spinal stenosis) along with chemical detoxification and treating neurologic diseases resulting from brain toxicity.

Holistic Therapies — Acupuncture, Hypnosis, Meditation, Physical Therapy, Osteopathy, Homeopathy, Red/Near Infrared Light, Bee Venom, Probiotics, Trigger Point Injections, Therapeutic Ultrasound, Cold Water Therapy, Bioresonance and Magnetism, Raw Diets

In the same way that DMSO enhances the therapeutic capacity of physical substances, many other therapies (e.g., acupuncture, physical therapy, or osteopathy) are significantly enhanced when done with DMSO, as are treatments that administer a therapeutic energy to the patient (e.g., infrared light). DMSO also has a relaxing and centering effect, which allows breakthroughs in both therapy (e.g., hypnosis) and self-healing (e.g., meditation). The benefits of many other holistic lifestyle practices (e.g., cold therapy) are enhanced by DMSO, and likewise other integrative therapies (e.g., homeopathy) have been reported to act synergistically with it.

Note: DMSO is also frequently used to create natural home cosmetics. In addition to these often being far more restorative and rejuvenating to the skin than commercial products, they have also become quite popular because they are much safer and more tolerable to the body than synthetic products, which are full of chemicals with varying degrees of toxicity.

Creating Your Own Home Remedies
A key goal of this series has been to provide the knowledge each of you can use to take charge of your own health at home, and for that reason, I’ve spent the last year trying to systematically lay out everything which needs to be known to understand how to make the best use of DMSO.

As this was the most complex (and arguably most important) part of the series, it was done last, and my main focus over the previous three months has been to go through thousands of reports and media presentations online detailing everyone’s experiences with the natural combinations to discern the consistent patterns with each combination.

In the second half of this article, I will discuss:

•How each of the previously mentioned natural therapies works (as many of them are virtually unknown within the integrative medical field).

•How they are used with DMSO.

•How they are able to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of DMSO, hence allowing it to cure illnesses that don’t respond to DMSO alone (e.g., sometimes this happens with osteoarthritis or migraine headaches).

•How a wide variety of diseases (e.g., chronic fatigue, cancer, chronic infections such as Lyme, cataracts, connective tissue disorders like varicose veins, acne, migraines, or issues with the prostate and thyroid) are treated by a DMSO combination.

Additionally, I will provide general guidance for using DMSO (e.g., where to obtain it and how it should be dosed for each part of the body), as I am finding more and more individuals are now being scammed with counterfeit products or using doses that are too high for them to tolerate.

Sourcing DMSO:
Since there are numerous options when purchasing DMSO, I’ve frequently received many questions about the best brands to use. Of these, I’ve long believed that these are the three best options (and I’ve included Amazon links for your purchase).

Note: unless you feel confident in diluting them correctly, opt for the 70% dilution, as that concentration typically works for most people.

•Jacob Lab (e.g., this gel or this liquid)—which is 99.98% pure.

•The DMSO Store (e.g., this gel or this liquid—which can also be bought directly from www.DMSOStore.com)—which is 99.995% pure (and hence often the most popular for internal applications).

•Nature’s Gift (e.g., this gel or this liquid)—which is 99.9% pure.

Note: dmso.store is a completely different company than dmsostore.com.

When buying liquid DMSO, I believe it should always be sold in a glass container unless the plastic container is DMSO resistant (which many are not—hence why I only recommended buying glass bottles) and likewise have a DMSO resistant cap. If you buy gel, it’s okay if it’s sold in plastic.
Note: many people have used liquid DMSO from plastic containers without issue, but I have personally always avoided doing so because glass DMSO has always been affordable and readily available so less thinking is involved to ensure it’s sold in a DMSO resistant plastic.

Of the currently existing options, I believe the best choice is to either:

•Buy DMSO directly from the DMSO store (DMSOstore.com).
Note: the website DMSO.store is for a completely different company.

•Buy it directly from Jacob lab (which readers have informed me is also shipping DMSO in plastic they claim is DMSO resistant—which it likely is, since Stanley Jacob’s son runs the company, and from talking to him, we know he is very dedicated to continuing his father’s work).

Note: I’ve now spoken to numerous people who purchased DMSO from someone promoting it online, and then shared that either they were scammed (nothing arrived after they paid) or the product that arrived wasn’t correct. People who engage in these types of activities tend to gravitate towards whatever is the “hot” item, and since DMSO is the current trend, I believe it is best to go with a longstanding vendor. Additionally, local sources of it (e.g., from Tractor Supply) are more than good enough for people’s immediate needs (e.g., an injury), but not ideal when preparing DMSO combinations (rather, I prefer the higher purity options available).

DMSO dosing:
One of the things that’s very challenging about using DMSO is that there is a significant amount of variation in what each individual will best respond to. Because of that, throughout this series, I attempted to provide a very detailed explanation that could account for each possibility, which was too complicated for many readers (but I would still advise reading).

However, most of it boils down to the following:

•If you use too high a dose, you risk the chance of having a bad reaction (which dozens of people have now told me made them not want) to use DMSO anymore, whereas if you use too low of a dose, the effect will be much less than desired (which may also lead to them abandoning DMSO). In turn, I’ve had many people here who:

•Applied 100% DMSO topically and had trouble believing anyone couldn’t tolerate that.

•Applied 70% DMSO topically, had a bit of irritation, but thought it was manageable.

• Applied 30% topically and felt it was too strong.

Similarly with oral dosing, I’ve had people who:

•Thought 1 teaspoon was decent, but quickly took more for a greater effect.

•Found a few drops was the optimal dose for them (and greatly benefitted), whereas 1 teaspoon while initially good, ended up feeling like it was too much for them and caused their sensitive system to react.

Because of this, you essentially have two options, and have to decide which is right for you:

•Be patient and start with a low dose, then build up progressively.

•Start a strong dose, and agree not to hold it against me or DMSO if you don’t tolerate it.

In the previous articles, I’ve advocated for the former. Still, many understandably started with a high dose as they did not want to wait for the results, and a few of them then shared they’d had a skin reaction that made them hesitant to continue using DMSO.

Similarly, when using DMSO, there are two common routes of application, orally and topically. Orally, it is much stronger, but likewise, the GI tract is more sensitive to higher concentrations of DMSO. For this reason, I typically suggest starting with topical DMSO before doing oral DMSO. However, for more systemic issues (e.g., joint pain throughout the body or low energy) oral is often necessary (and in many cases works well if done with topical DMSO).

Likewise, there is a minimal risk (1 in 2000) of an allergic reaction, so it’s generally advised to begin by patch testing DMSO on the skin before taking it orally.

So, What is Patch Testing?
Patch testing is a method used to determine how the application reacts to a product. It's a smart way to test a small area first before applying the product to larger areas, which helps to identify any adverse reactions.

How to Patch Test:

•Select a Small Area: Choose a discreet spot.
•Apply a Tiny Amount: Use a small quantity of the product.
•Wait and Observe: Leave it on for 24 hours unless you notice irritation sooner.
•Proceed if All’s Good: If there’s no reaction, feel confident to use the product as intended!

*If in contact with the skin: some experience itching and tingling sensations and irritation, which are normal. If there are any signs of an allergic reaction (e.g., swelling), wash the area immediately and discontinue use.

That said, for general DMSO use (without going into all the nuances and additional details), I advise the following:

Start with 30-50% DMSO and see how you tolerate it. If applying to the face, make sure all makeup has been washed off (and ideally that you are only using natural cosmetic products) and use a lower initial concentration (20%).

If you have no issue, gradually raise it to 70%. Many find 60% suffices for most musculoskeletal issues, while 30% is often needed for sensitive skin.

Only raise it past 70% if you are certain you are one of those people who are fine with 100% or you are using it for a specific application that can justify a higher concentration (e.g., a collagen contracture, a scar, an internal adhesion or an acute stroke).

If you have immediate issues with topical administration (e.g., burning or redness) that you cannot tolerate, wash off with water and try a lower dose. If your skin becomes cracked or dry after repeated use, take a break and hydrate the area with aloe or a natural oil.

Until you are comfortable with topical applications, avoid oral applications, and only use them if you think you need them (or topical does not work for a reason besides an allergic reaction).

For oral dosing, start with a teaspoon of 70% or 100% DMSO mixed into a glass of water (you may also want juice, a smoothie or milk to eliminate DMSO’s taste), as a heavily diluted solution is best to start with

If you have issues with that, lower the dose to half a teaspoon and then to a quarter teaspoon.

Otherwise, stay at a teaspoon for at least three days, and then if you think you need a more substantial effect, go to 2 teaspoons.

More than 4 teaspoons in a glass of water is excessive, and at that point, you are better off dividing the dose throughout the day.

With both topical and oral DMSO, people generally find that as time goes on, their reactivities to it decreases (so they better tolerate it). Conversely, if it’s used too frequently, particularly for chronic pain, a tolerance can develop, so it’s generally advised not to take it 1-2 days a week if it needs to be taken long term.

Note: more detailed instructions on oral (and IV) DMSO use can be found here, while more detailed instructions on topical uses can be found here. Additionally, concentrations above 20% can leach certain materials (discussed further here) so DMSO at higher concentrations should be handled and diluted with non-reactive materials.

Regarding the concentrations used, I generally advise buying 70% DMSO because people rarely react to it (e.g., the DMSO community felt it was the concentration that had the best balance between safety and efficacy). It doesn’t require any significant calculations to dose appropriately (e.g., you can apply it topically as it is, or mix it with equal parts of purified water to get it to roughly 35%). However, you can also do all of that with 100% DMSO (e.g., dilute it to roughly 50% rather than 35% by mixing it with equal parts of purified water or to roughly 33% by mixing it with two parts of purified water). Finally, certain parts of the body, particularly the face, tend to be more sensitive to higher concentrations of DMSO, so you should start at lower strengths in those areas.

If you are putting DMSO on the face, start at 30% and do not start with a stronger concentration, as this can cause significant skin irritation. For example, I had one reader who started with a 70% gel on the face, who contacted me about a reaction they had (although after the surface layer of skin peeled off, her face underneath did look much younger).

Additionally, a challenge in dosing DMSO is that it weighs slightly more than water (1 mL of DMSO is 1.1004 grams). Since DMSO has a relatively wide range of tolerability, I’ve bypassed that issue by treating it as having the same density as water and suggesting a slightly lower oral dose.

Note: when DMSO is taken by mouth, the total concentration should always be kept to 20% or less, and ideally, it should be taken slowly after eating a meal.

When applying DMSO topically, there are two options. The first is to use a liquid that you directly apply (e.g., I like to use paintbrushes made from natural hairs to dab it on, but sometimes when needed, I just dip my finger in it and then rub it onto the target area, whereas the DMSO field often uses sprays for sensitive skin conditions). The second is to use a gel that is rubbed into the skin.
Note: DMSO will leach many plastics at concentrations above 20%. For this reason, 15% or lower is often advised for situations where it has to come into direct contact with them. Conversely, when DMSO is mixed with water, it will temporarily heat up. This is a natural dissolution reaction between the two which has nothing to do with anything being leached.

I personally prefer the liquids because it’s easier to control the total dose with them, more of the substance gets into the body, and liquid DMSO tends to be less irritating. That said, gels hold the advantage of continually releasing DMSO into the body over a prolonged period and are much easier to apply. As a result, the choice you make is largely a matter of personal preference.

Note: as mentioned above, when applying DMSO topically, it is essential first to clean the area where it is being used.

Lastly, since many readers have requested it, this is a general guideline on what doses of DMSO tend to be appropriate for each part of the body:

Internal Use (Oral):

Starting Dose: 1-2 teaspoons in an 8 ounce (or greater) glass of water.

Increase: Up to 6 teaspoons (~18 ml) twice daily for treatment.

Body Weight-Based: 0.05-0.1 g/kg/day (e.g., 7 g for 70 kg, ~2.5 teaspoons), with higher doses (typically up to 2 g/kg) for emergencies (e.g., heart attack or cancer).

Note: as DMSO has an unpleasant taste, it is frequently consumed with juice and away from meals. Additionally, if DMSO is mixed with one of the natural agents which is an acid, over time this can become irritating to the digestive tract (so typically topical preparations are done instead).

External Use (Skin):

Concentrations:

Legs/Feet: 50–80% (70% typical).

Arms/Torso/Neck: 40–70% (50% typical).

Head/Face: 25–35%. (some go up to 50% for the head)

Wounds: 40–60%.

Warts/Boils: 75%.

Sensitive Skin: Start at 30%.

Application: 2–3 times daily, adjusted based on skin sensitivity and response.

Precautions: Avoid >15% on surgical stitches to prevent brittleness.

Ideal routes of application include with natural hair brushes (dabbing creates less irritation than rubbing), with your own (clean) fingers, or with a spray bottle (particularly for open wounds or areas that are otherwise hard to reach on your own body). With spray bottles, glass ones which have been pre-washed with DMSO are ideal.
Note: gloves should never be used to apply DMSO to the skin.

Mucous Membranes:

Mouthwash: 5–15% solution, swish for 2–4 minutes (can go higher if no dental implants).

Ear/Nose Drops: 15–40% (15% minimizes irritation).

Other (e.g., oral, rectal, vaginal): around 10% is often recommended due to high tissue permeability.

Gum issues/inflammations: Use 5–15% mouthwash.

Aphthous ulcers/cold sores: Dab directly (often with 100% DMSO).

Injections:

Concentration: 15% for subcutaneous, intraarticular, intraperitoneal.

Intramuscular/Intravenous: 3-25% in an isotonic solution (discussed further here—we tend to use 3-5%, 7.5% is frequently recommended, most of the published studies, particularly in acute emergencies used higher doses).

Eyes: 3% isotonic solution has the best balance of safety and efficacy (although many go up to 40% which I feel is a bit too high—20-30% should be the maximum).

Nebulizer: 1% isotonic solution (although some go much higher).
Note: be sure to clean the nebulizer before nebulizing DMSO.

Lastly, in some cases, particularly injuries, DMSO is applied by soaking a bandage in it (or a DMSO mixture), placed on the affected area, and then wrapped with other bandages to ensure a continuous DMSO exposure. In those instances, due to the prolonged exposure lower concentrations can be required.
Note: after prolonged DMSO exposure, DMSO can cause the fingers to wrinkle in a manner similar to being in water for a prolonged period but will recover in a few days.

Dilution agents
Presently, some of the most popular (and beneficial) DMSO agents which have been identified include:

•Isotonic, 0.9% saline (which you can prepare yourself and is widely sold).

•Nano-filtered deep-sea seawater, rich in essential minerals including those that enhance cellular transport, is a popular carrier for DMSO due to its therapeutic synergy. As seawater has three times the osmolarity of blood, isotonic formulations are purchased or created by diluting seawater (one part seawater to two parts purified water). These formulations are often applied cosmetically, such as 10% DMSO in isotonic seawater for facial toners, or ingested when diluted. They also support gut health, hydration, and tissue repair (e.g., ulcerative colitis) in sterile preparations like enemas (10% DMSO, 10 mL seawater in 90 mL DMSO solution) or nasal/ear drops (5% DMSO) and typically are used 1–2 times daily.
Note: there is a long history of isotonic seawater being healing and numerous brands of it on the market (e.g., Quinton’s is one of the best).

•12% magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) diluted in water. This is used for a wide range of conditions including scars, hair loss and polyneuropathy (with 6 parts DMSO, 4 parts 12% MgCl₂), sensitive dry or crack skin and facial scars (3 parts DMSO, 7 parts 12% MgCl₂), internal applications such as ear or nose drops, enemas, and mouth washes for gum inflammation (1.5 parts DMSO, 8.5 parts 12% MgCl₂ or saline), wound healing, fatigue, and a variety of musculoskeletal condition (e.g., it relaxes muscles).
Note: when concentrations above 12% are used (e.g., the 30% in magnesium oil) it can cause the DMSO mixtures to harden and become unusable.

Additionally, the following diluents are sometimes used:

•One’s urine (discussed below)

•Thermal (hot spring) water, typically used for cosmetic applications as it contains skin soothing minerals (e.g., sodium, magnesium, potassium and calcium sulfate) and is sometimes used prior to cosmetic ultrasound.

•Basic water (e.g., with a pH of 9.5) which is used to support detoxification protocols (but care must be taken to avoid excessively basic water).

•Coconut water (due to being isotonic and the numerous healing properties of coconuts).

•Glycerin

•Filtered rainwater (which is not isotonic).

•Dilute hydrogen peroxide or colloidal silver (discussed below)

•Procaine (for scars and interference fields and discussed in the previous article)

Note: with many of these dilutants, particularly for internal use, it is advised to use a DMSO resistant syringe filter (e.g., a 200 nm one) in order to prepare them.

Finally, when DMSO baths are taken, as that would require an immense amount of DMSO (along with bacteria that metabolize it into odorous dimethyl sulfide), DMSO is instead sprayed onto the body before the bath, and then something else which works synergistically with DMSO is put in the bathwater.

Urine Therapy
Urine therapy (drinking or topically applying one’s own urine) has been practiced around the world for at least 5,000 years (particularly within Ayurveda). While there is currently no supporting evidence for it, its proponents often report it helps with:
•General health (e.g., detoxification, energy, and vitality).
•Skin conditions (e.g, acne, eczema, psoriasis, burns, fungal infections).
•Autoimmune disorders (e.g., arthritis, allergies), diabetes and infections.
•Cancer
•Oral Hygiene.
•Weight loss, diabetes and improving the gut microbiome.

How urine therapy works is a bit of a debate, but it is most likely due to one of the following:
1. Urea, the primary substance besides water in urine, has numerous therapeutic effects (e.g., being hydrating to the skin, antimicrobial, assisting with wound healing or scar remodeling, and being a diuretic which eliminates edema in specific parts of the body like the eyes)
2. Antigens within urine modulate the immune system.
Note: low-dose immunotherapy (which frequently helps chronic illnesses) identifies an infectious microbe likely causing issues (either because a chronic infection is there or because the immune system has developed a harmful reactivity to it), then heavily dilutes it and mixes it with enzyme beta-glucuronidase to enhance immune tolerance, after which it is swallowed or injected. In challenging cases where it is unclear which diluted microbe to use, practitioners will instead use the patient’s stool or urine, dilute it, then run it through a millipore filter prior to injecting (e.g., urine is often used in Lyme patients with chronic interstitial cystitis or vulvovaginitis).

While I do not personally have any experience with urine therapy, many people I know over the years (most of whom did it during the time they spent in India) have sworn by the benefits of the practice and always emphasized you could not eat meat while doing it.

I mention all of this because a section of the DMSO community, mindful of urine’s therapeutic properties (e.g., being rich in urea and antigens) and urine simply being filtered blood plasma, decided to combine it with DMSO and found it helped:

•Skin Conditions such as acne, eczema and neurodermatitis (where DMSO is diluted to 10-30% with urine and soothes the skin), warts and herpes, pigmentation disorders and stretch marks, along with it simply improving general skin health (e.g., texture, reducing spots or increasing tightness).

•Hair growth (as for this application, DMSO is typically diluted to 60% with either MgCl₂ or urine).

•Scar treatment (either topically or being directly injected into the scar), often in combination with something else (e.g., MgCl₂, procaine or isotonic seawater) and DMSO being diluted to 5-10%. In addition to scars, this is also sometimes used for other types of interference fields (e.g., on the olfactory nerve in loss of smell, one causing a chronic infection or one preventing tissue regeneration).

•Diseases of the ear canal (e.g., tinnitus and ear infections) and mucus membranes, such as the nasal mucosa (e.g., nasal polyps, sinusitis or lost smell), the colon (in enemas for inflammatory bowel diseases and smaller 60 ml ones for children prone to bowel infections)—where in most cases urine is used to dilute DMSO to 10-15%.

Safety guidelines for this dilutant mirror those seen in urine therapy (e.g., no meat or fish for at least 2-3 days beforehand, medications like diclofenac which persist in the urine must be discontinued 3 days prior, midstream urine should be obtained and prepared immediately prior to use, and if injected, urine must be millipore filtered), with a midstream taste test often used to verify the urine is “normal.”

Note: one’s blood (rather than urine) is also sometimes combined with DMSO.

Natural Combinations
Over the last six months, I’ve done my best to concisely share all that is known about each popular natural DMSO combination. When reviewing this list, it’s important to keep in mind that:

•The descriptions given are specifically referring to the aspects of the substance which are relevant or enhanced when used with DMSO, rather than it alone. So, to save space, unless stated otherwise, assume the effect described for something results from it being used in conjunction with DMSO.

•With the exception of cosmetics, I chose to sort this by the substance rather than the condition treated. Since multiple agents are often used for the same condition, if you want to know about a specific one (e.g., “prostate”), you will need to search the article for it.

•As there is such a wide safety margin with DMSO, I believe many different doses could be used for these combinations. Since it will likely never be feasible to conduct the research to determine the optimal doses for each one, most authors (and individual readers) simply made their best guess on what to do (which in most cases worked). For this reason, I will be somewhat vague about the “correct” dose, as I have no way to know what it is and don’t want to pretend that I do. Instead, I will highlight the dosing information I believe is important to understand and there appears to be some basis for.

Carrier Oils and Topical Bases
In addition to diluting DMSO with a liquid, it is sometimes mixed with a thicker substance, which is typically already used in natural medicine as a solo therapeutic to dilute substances like essential oils. Of these, three are commonly used:

•Aloe Vera—this is the most common agent mixed with DMSO, as it rehydrates the skin (either being applied concurrently or 30 minutes after DMSO) and in many cases extenuates DMSO’s healing properties. Most commonly they are used together to soothe the skin (e.g., for sun burns, eczema, or acne), for wound healing (e.g., in a mouthwash taken a few times a day for a molar abscess), often in combination with calendula, but has also shown promise for prostatitis (where it is typically rectally administered) and complex regional pain syndrome (where it is massaged into the affected area).

•Castor Oil—This is frequently used for musculoskeletal and eye issues, so before long it became combined with DMSO for those situations. This combination is thought to be excellent for rheumatic complaints (e.g., spinal issues, joint pain and painful previously fractured bones), something many readers have attested to,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 along with eye issues (e.g., cataracts), something that quite a few readers here have likewise found worked1,2,3,4,5,6 (along with various lumps and masses under the skin).
Note: one doctor recently shared with me, “I’ve had great results with DMSO and castor oil for pains and myalgias.”

This combination is also used for other musculoskeletal issues (e.g., healing tendons and scar tissue) and amongst the 80 or so readers who’ve used it, I’ve also heard success stories for many other conditions (e.g., neuropathies, fungal infections, facial skin issues, eczema, rashes, an umbilical hernia etc.). In most of these reports, I could see DMSO alone creating these benefits, but in some instances (e.g., for cataracts and certain musculoskeletal issues), there does appear to be an enhancement from using castor oil (whereas conversely one reader reported castor oil without DMSO did very little for them).

The exact doses and routes of application used for castor oil greatly vary (e.g., authors recommend applying it first, then applying DMSO on top ten minutes later), while many readers have simply applied DMSO castor mixtures with widely varying concentrations. Likewise, many people are using DMSO Castor Oil eye drops because another Substack promoted a website selling a 30% DMSO 70% castor oil mix. This is a much stronger concentration than the DMSO community generally supports (but nonetheless, some have since had success with it). So, like many other DMSO applications, I would highly recommend starting with low castor oil concentrations before proceeding to higher ones.
Note: in the migraine case I shared above, castor oil and cayenne pepper were used in combination with DMSO—which remarkably is just one of many combinations individuals have found to treat stubborn migraines.

Finally, castor oil packs over internal organs is a longstanding natural medicine practice which is significantly enhanced with DMSO (e.g., we’ve found it calms liver inflammation which is quite helpful when a patient is experiencing liver toxicity from a pharmaceutical drug they are on that they can’t stop taking).

Note: the extraction process for castor oil can often involve chemicals like hexanes, so for DMSO applications, it is best to use a purer grade of it. Additionally, some sources caution against using it with cancer or while lactating or during pregnancy (as there is a risk of it triggering a premature delivery).

•Coconut Oil—This is most commonly used to prevent skin irritation or dryness from DMSO (especially from chronic use), and for skin issues (e.g., acne, eczema, chapped skin) or cosmetic preparations, although I have also seen a few people report general DMSO benefits (e.g., joint pain reduction) with coconut oil mixtures. Typically it’s advised to start with using 10-20% coconut oil, whereas in therapeutic applications, 50% is often needed. Finally, MCT oil is sometimes used when a more substantial therapeutic effect is required (e.g., for joint pain).

Note: I have a strong suspicion that coconut or MCT oil DMSO combinations would be quite helpful for Alzheimer’s, as each has been shown in clinical trials to improve dementia,1,2 and many readers have reported success from all three for Alzheimer’s. However, like so many other DMSO combinations, I do not know of any instances where this has been tried.

•Hydroxyethylcellulose—this is the most popular natural and non-reactive material to combine with DMSO for making creams and gels. To the best of my knowledge it has no independent medical value.

•Shea Butter—this is typically used in homemade cosmetic formulations.

•Beef Tallow—this is currently in vogue in cosmetics, but is quite greasy as it does not absorb well into the skin and sits on it. Once mixed with DMSO it does, hence becoming more effective and less messy.

Note: many other carrier oils have also been mixed with DMSO (e.g., olive or jojoba oil).

Essential Oils
As the widely used essential oils are applied topically and potent enough to affect the body in that manner, many have been combined with DMSO and have frequently successfully treated patients when this was done. As they are quite potent, you usually want to dilute the oil down to 10% (e.g., 1 drop of oil plus 10 drops DMSO), and not exceed 20%.

I am presently familiar with the following combinations (and suspect many others exist):

•Frankincense—Known for its anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties, it is often used conditions like knee pain, back pain and sciatica. Additionally, when rubbed onto the roof of the mouth it can promote parasympathetic activation (which for example helps cancer patients if done twice a day).

Note: I read one report of a DMSO combination that included heart seed, frankincense, and Artemisia, which appeared to treat psoriasis. As heart seed was the primary ingredient, its creator thought it was the only necessary component, whereas the scientific evidence showed frankincense was the most likely active agent.

•Tea Tree—Tea tree oil is known for its antibacterial, antiparasitic, and antifungal (and to a lesser extent antiviral) antiparasitic activity, and as such, it is one of the most common antimicrobials mixed with DMSO and used to treat a wide range of infections (e.g., sprayed into wounds, for folliculitis or as a reader reported, an angular cheilitis which had not responded to 15 years of natural and conventional therapies) along with many other things like insect bites. However, as tea tree oil can be somewhat irritating, it should be patch tested before use.
Note: thyme (particularly red thyme essential oil) and oil of oregano are powerful antimicrobials (but also quite irritating). As such, I could see them being immensely effective DMSO combinations but also potentially too irritating to combine.

•Peppermint Essential—This cooling oil relaxes muscles and blood flow. It is often used alone or with DMSO to relieve pain, headaches (including migraines), and nerve inflammation (e.g., sciatica) or swallowed for digestion. When applied topically, it is often added to a 50% DMSO solution or mixed with a gel (e.g., a blend of 1/2 cup of aloe vera, 2 tablespoons of DMSO, and 10 drops of peppermint oil).

•Lavender—This frequently used oil is quite helpful for muscle cramps and joint pain, reduces anxiety, improves sleep, and sometimes is used for asthma attacks, and is frequently mixed into DMSO creams or gels.
Note: this combination can be irritating if lavender is not sufficiently diluted.

•Eucalyptus—This relieves joint/muscle soreness with anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., for asthma), and is sometimes used in pain mixtures.

•Myrrh—This also relieves back and knee pain and has anti-inflammatory properties,.

•Black Pepper—This enhances blood and lymphatic circulation and is used in pain relief mixtures to reduce inflammation.

•Wintergreen—This also has pain relieving properties, although caution is advised due to salicylate content.

•Clary Sage—Used as a muscle relaxant.
Note: we’ve used clary sage (without DMSO) topically on the belly for menstrual cramps, so I suspect a DMSO combination would be helpful here.

•Sweet Birch—Used as a muscle relaxant.

Lastly, a variety of Ayurvedic oils and herbal preparations can also be mixed with DMSO to make potent formulations for reducing inflammation, joint pain and muscle stiffness.

Botanicals
In addition to essential oils, many other botanicals have been successfully combined with DMSO:

•Arnica and Comfrey—These, particularly arnica, are well known for healing musculoskeletal injuries. So in many cases they (particularly arnica) are combined with DMSO (or DMSO and magnesium) to relieve aches pain and bruising, heal ligament or tendon injuries (e.g., sprains, tennis elbow and achilles tendon pain) and support tissue repair, with some reporting a spray of those four has effectively addressed all aches, pain and injuries in the family and others noticing greatly accelerated healing (e.g., recoveries in 1-2 weeks instead of months).

Note: I have not been able to determine if homeopathic arnica, an extract of the herb itself or both are being used in many of the therapeutic DMSO formulations I’ve come across. In the only one where it was specified, a 1/4 cup arnica oil and 1/4 cup shea butter were melted together, then blended in 2 tablespoons of DMSO and 10 drops of lavender oil.

•Turmeric—As turmeric is a highly potent (but safe) anti-inflammatory agent and the the active ingredient in it (curcumin) absorbs poorly, it is well suited for being combined with DMSO and often used to treat conditions such as joint inflammation, gastritis, knee pain and general pain (likewise three readers found it immediately, and often permanently, eliminates pain1,2,3). Additionally, one reader used it with ginger to eliminate a lipoma, while another used it with green tea extract to eliminate a seborrheic keratosis.
Note: one formulation mixed a teaspoon of turmeric powder in 200ml of 75% DMSO.

•Ginseng—When mixed with DMSO, the bioavailability of Ginseng (and thus its ability to increase energy, vitality, and overall well being) significantly increased.

•Black Cumin Seed Oil—this anti-inflammatory oil is potentiated by DMSO and many have found immediate pain relief from it (typically using two parts DMSO to one part nigella sativa oil).

•Cayenne Pepper (Capsicum)—this is generally done for pain relief (particularly neuropathic pain and migraines) or to improve circulation. Due to capsicum’s potency, it is important to use a low dose of it (especially at the start).

•Pansy Tea—Viola tricolor is a soothing herb and a popular combination with DMSO as it improves skin tolerance to DMSO, and alleviates inflamed skin (e.g., this combination is used for itchy bites, sunburns, eczema, psoriasis, and neurodermitis).
Typically, the tea is mixed with DMSO to dilute DMSO to 10-20%, with some mixtures (e.g. for eczema) instead having some of that dilution come from seawater or urine (e.g., 3 parts urine, 3 parts pansy tea, 3 parts sea water, 1 part DMSO or 5 parts pansy tea, 4 parts urine).

•Lemon Balm—this has been observed to be helpful for acne and herpes (e.g., blisters or cold sores; sometimes in combination with almond oil or therapeutic clays), along with gastrointestinal complaints, gallbladder diseases, difficulty falling asleep, and colds. Additionally, it relaxes the nervous system and when applied to the thyroid it can improve symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
Note: passion flower mixtures are also used for many similar calming effects.

•Eyebright (Euphrasia Rostkoviana)—This is one of the top DMSO combinations for eye health (e.g., cataracts) and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Eye drops are typically 10% DMSO and 10% of the extract (e.g.(1 ml of each plus 8ml saline), taken 1–2 times daily and prepared in a sterile manner to avoid eye infections.
Note: blueberry extract, l-Carnosine (particularly N-Acetyl-L-Carnosine), l-Carnitine, and taurine are sometimes used to enhance the efficacy of DMSO eye drops (and sometimes are used alone without DMSO for eye health)—and one reader reported that they eliminated their cataracts. In some instances, when these are combined, one of those is put on first (with the eyes closed), and then, after about 10 minutes DMSO drops are put on. Additionally, sometimes eye drops are combined with MSM or ascorbic acid.

•Strophanthus and Hawthorn—Both of these are well known in herbology for their ability to protect and heal the heart, autonomic nervous system and blood vessels. As such, are used in combination with DMSO for cardiovascular issues (e.g., taking a few drops under the tongue a few times a day of an extract containing both herbs and DMSO).

•Cannabinoids—CBD oil’s uses (particularly reducing seizures, inflammation, pain, and neuropathies) are well known within the natural medicine community and enhanced in DMSO combinations. Typically, CBD oil is used as a topical; THC-containing cannabis extracts can have hallucinogenic effects once mixed with DMSO. Additionally, high CBD strains have been observed to be more therapeutically effective, while recreational marijuana users tend to experience less benefit from this combination.
Note: multiple readers1,2,3 have reported this combination helped their arthritis, pain, neuropathies, and arthritis (e.g., thumb arthritis that was scheduled for surgery, or cancer pain from chemotherapy and metastases).

•Amygdalin—this is a natural cancer therapy (also known as B17 or laetrile) from apricot kernels that the FDA successfully blacklisted and erased from memory. At the time it was in use, many integrative doctors observed a significant synergy when it was mixed with DMSO in IVs and routinely used that combination to treat cancer (often in combination with other treatments). Recently, these combinations have been rediscovered by the German DMSO community (e.g., this cancer doctor reported adding DMSO and hematoxylin to his amygdalin protocols greatly improved his results), who in turn have proposed dosing regimens such as 9g infusions each day (plus DMSO) for 3 weeks followed by 3 months of oral amygdalin.

Note: many other alternative cancer treatments (e.g., pancreatic enzymes, vitamins C, E, and A, and shark cartilage) have also been combined with DMSO and laetrile.

•Sulforaphane—One reader reported they have been treating their Parkinson’s with sulforaphane obtained through a Broccoli Seed Tea as it targets key aspects of the disease process and has improved their non-motor symptoms (e.g., constipation, brain fog, fatigue, and urinary urgency). Once mixed with DMSO, motor symptoms improved, suggesting either DMSO improved sulforaphane’s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier or DMSO alone treated those symptoms.
Note: Ginkgo DMSO mixtures (along with many other herbal formulations) are often used to improve cerebral circulation and enhance cognitive function, memory, or mental clarity.

•Black Salve Extract—This has long been used to topically treats skin cancers and lesions, but caution is warranted as it can cause irritation, scarring and excessive tissue destruction. DMSO enhances its ability to penetrate tumors and makes it possible to have a more focused cancer treatment. Some have also found that when combined with DMSO, it will draw things embedded under the skin (e.g., glass, splinters, or ticks) to the surface.

•Horse chestnut—this herbal extract strengthens blood vessel walls, reduces vascular inflammation and has minor anticoagulant properties so it’s used to enhance venous tone and blood circulation and decrease capillary permeability and edema (hence making it well suited for treating varicose veins).
Note: there are many other botanicals that synergize with DMSO which I was not able to get to due to the length of this article.

Vitamins and Antioxidants
In addition to amplifying their classic uses, the DMSO field has discovered some rather remarkable uses for many common nutraceuticals:

•Vitamin C—Topical vitamin C and DMSO has been used to treat skin cancers (e.g., one reader replicated the results of the study I discussed above), to shrink overgrown scars (normally taking 6-8 weeks) and for a variety of localized infections (e.g., one reader used it to heal a longstanding tooth abscess and while another treated a severe eye infection). Likewise, IV formulations have also been used to treat chronic infections in individuals with a depleted immune system (e.g., slowly infusing 7.5g of ascorbic acid and 10 ml of 3% H₂O₂ with DMSO diluted in saline). I’ve also seen vitamin C used in formulations that promoted increased wellness (e.g., less pain or fatigue), but it’s unclear how much it was responsible for those effects.
Note: a major challenge with vitamin C is absorbing enough of it into the body (hence making DMSO an ideal match). However, many forms of vitamin C (e.g., ascorbic acid) are acidic. They can be difficult to tolerate if brought directly into the body, so for that reason, buffered forms (e.g., ascorbate) are advised for DMSO formulations.

•Vitamin B12—Since not all diets contain adequate vitamin B12 and people often have difficulty absorbing it, B12 is one of the most commonly injected nutraceuticals, and one which patients frequently report a benefit from. As such, B12 is well suited to be combined with DMSO, and many have reported getting a rapid boost in energy, general strength, happiness, and well being from topical preparations, which greatly exceeds what oral B12 can provide (which skips the hassles associated with B12 shots—particularly in children).
Note: currently the best guess is that this should be done once a month, and while topical is more common, oral administration is also sometimes done.

Furthermore, DMSO B12 drops can sometimes be beneficial for nerve regeneration. This has been the most extensively explored with a nasal spray for lost smell (e.g., following a viral infection), but it has also been used for tinnitus and hearing loss (with ear drops).

Note: while DMSO and B12 can be used alone, other things can also be added. For example, one German nasal spray (also used for nasal polyps, sinusitis, allergies, and jaw pain) contains 0-1 drops of 3% H₂O₂, 2ml 1-2% procaine, 1-2ml B12 (1500-3000 mcg), 1.5ml 100% DMSO and 4.5-6.5ml isotonic seawater.

•Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)—MSM (oxidized DMSO) is the primary metabolite of DMSO that shares many tissue healing and anti-inflammatory qualities with DMSO, and as such is sometimes used as a partial substitute for DMSO for individuals who cannot tolerate the odor DMSO creates.

Interestingly, when DMSO is combined with MSM, its ability to heal and rebuild tissue (e.g., cartilage, scar tissue, wounds) and treat joint issues (e.g., reduce stiffness from osteoarthritis) is significantly enhanced (e.g., see this reader’s story). This can be done topically or orally (orally being more popular) at roughly 300 mg (0.27ml) DMSO + 500 mg MSM each day, and I have come across numerous reports of individuals with severe knee or hip osteoarthritis having a dramatic improvement in pain following drinking this combination.
Note: the oral MSM dose can eventually be raised to 2000mg a day, and as it also potentiates DMSO, the DMSO dose can later be lowered.

Numerous studies have also shown that MSM has potent anticancer activity,1,2 including against triple-negative breast cancers, and causes melanomas to differentiate into healthy cells (something DMSO also does). As such, there is interest within the DMSO field for exploring this combination, but to the best of my knowledge, no one has. There is also some data showing MSM drops help eye issues (e.g., cataracts and eye dryness), and I have occasionally come across reports (e.g., from this reader) of it eliminating them.
Note: readers have also reported this combination helping their horse’s knees. Additionally, DMSO-MgCl₂ (e.g., DMSO diluted to 60% with 12% MgCl₂) or DMSO-MgCl₂-procaine have also been found to be helpful for osteoarthritis.

•Vitamin D and B12—These have been used to improve immune function for fighting chronic infections (e.g., B12 helps the body produce immune cells).

•Vitamin E—Topical preparations and suppositories have been used for prostate enlargement, and vitamin E has also been used to support skin healing.

•Vitamin K—Many parents have concerns about giving their children vitamin K shots (as there is data showing it predisposes them to chronic illness). While it’s debatable if the shots are needed (e.g., you can take oral drops, and much of what vitamin K is “needed” for, cord blood will provide if it is not prematurely clamped), mixing DMSO with vitamin K potentially provides a safe and equivalent alternative to injections.

•B-complexes and multivitamins—These have been used for neuroprotection and symptom management in Parkinson’s regimens.

•Glutathione and N-Acetyl Cysteine—Glutathione is vital for the body but as it does not absorb through ingestion, a variety of approaches have been developed to increase it such as consuming its precursor N-Acetyl Cysteine, injecting it, ingesting liposomal glutathione (which in the brands we checked did not increase blood glutathione levels) or nebulizing it. As IV glutathione is often quite helpful, and the molecule is small enough for DMSO to transport, I was surprised to discover no one has explored this formulation (and likewise, it’s unclear if DMSO combined with NAC is being actively explored). Rather, the only combination I am aware of is nebulized glutathione and DMSO, which (provided it’s done safely) is remarkably effective for asthma and otherwise incurable respiratory conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis and COPD).
Note: As NAC, like DMSO, has often been used to treat complex regional pain syndrome, there would likely be a therapeutic synergy here, but to the best of my knowledge, no one has attempted it.

•Coenzyme Q10—This is sometimes used for mitochondrial support (e.g., for fatigue or neurodegenerative diseases) but remains relatively unexplored by the DMSO community. Interesting, one reader reported doing research where CoQ10 combined with DMSO yielded very promising results in treating spinal cord injuries in rats.

•Super Oxide Dismutase—in the past an ACAM physician reported DMSO in combination with SOD treated cataracts and glaucoma (as did one later author), with opinions differing on both the appropriate dosing or if SOD was even necessary for the cataract removal.

Minerals
While any mineral could be combined with DMSO, presently, a few promising candidates have been discovered by the DMSO field:

•Magnesium Chloride—Magnesium chloride is one of the most popular things to combine DMSO with (particularly for musculoskeletal issues). When combined, 12% MgCl₂ should be used (rather than the higher concentration in magnesium oil) as otherwise it can thicken and harden the DMSO mixture. Additionally, it some cases, magnesium malate is mixed with DMSO as it effectively chelates aluminum, has been reported to dissolve salivary stones (while in parallel, malic acid mixed with baking soda is reported to dissolve deposits) and according to one author, an unpublished European military study found magnesium malate [without DMSO] was highly therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases).
Note: many other less common DMSO protocols incorporate magnesium chloride (e.g., given intravenously with hydrogen peroxide for vascular diseases or chemotherapy damage and given with a combination of other nutraceuticals like vitamin C, B-vitamins and selenium for a chronically infected and swollen leg).

•Iodine—two forms of iodine are commonly combined with DMSO, povidone iodine, and Lugol’s (iodine plus potassium iodide), with Lugol’s typically being used. Most commonly, it's used for chronic fungal infections (e.g., in the nails), where it is consistently reported to work (although it often takes a while). I have also seen it be used for other types of infections such as ulcers, ear canal infections, dental infections hand, swelling from an insect bite (where the hand is bathed in Lugol’s and then afterwards DMSO is rubbed on), or nebulized (e.g., for COPD infections).
Note: while many have reported nebulizing Lugol’s with DMSO (e.g., 10% DMSO, 1–2 drops in 5 mL saline 1–2 times daily), I am not sure if it is safe to do so.

As many tissues rely upon iodine (and a good case can be made that iodine deficiency underlies many chronic diseases), the DMSO community has extensively explored using Lugol’s to bring topical iodine into ailing glands, finding this helps various thyroid, prostate, parotid, and breast issues. It also should be noted that gland enlargement and then cancer often correlate with the gland being unable to get enough of something it needs (goiter in the thyroid from an iodine deficiency being the classic example).
Note: the ovaries also concentrate and depend upon iodine, so I would expect it to help there too, but I have not yet come across this use. Likewise, boron is important for prostate health (e.g., the gland concentrates boron) but I have not come across any boron-prostate DMSO protocols.

For infections, a solution which is 10% Lugols (diluted to 5%) and then 90% DMSO and water is often used. For general health, pure DMSO diluted to 50% by 5% Lugol’s is applied to a region of skin (e.g., inside the elbows or on the forearm), while when put on a specific gland, further dilution is often used (e.g., 3ml 100% DMSO plus 6ml 12% MgCl₂ plus 20 drops of 5% Lugols) and then sprayed onto the target gland every 1-2 days.
Note: when applying to an enlarged prostate, it is normally put onto the perineum or administered intrarectally onto the prostate. Additionally, some DMSO authors believe it is also important to massage and soften the calf muscles in prostate conditions.

•Colloidal Silver—colloidal silver has a broad range of antimicrobial activities while also being fairly non-irritating to human tissue, making it an ideal substance to combine with DMSO (as there is both efficacy and safety). As such, it is used in a wide range of infections (e.g., eye infections, eyelid infections, ulcers, wounds, sinusitis), sometimes helps other illnesses (e.g., arthritis,1,2 asthma, warts, rashes, bladder cancer, cataracts), and is administered in every way imaginable.

This includes eye drops, being nebulized for a lung infection, or since it’s excreted through the kidneys, drank for kidney infections (e.g., one person reported 200ml colloidal silver plus 1 teaspoon DMSO treated pyelonephritis within an hour). Finally, since there is such a wide range of tolerance to colloidal silver (and effective doses), many different regimens exist which “work” (e.g., a 50/50 mixture of DMSO and the colloidal silver preparation).

Note: the major issue with using colloidal silver is that many preparations are not true colloids and hence can deposit within the body (and in very instances lead to skin color changes). For anyone planning to nebulize it or administer it with DMSO, I recommend using a high-quality brand such as Argentyn 23.

•Sodium Selenite—Selenium protects the body from oxidative stress and is an essential mineral for the thyroid and immune system (e.g., selenium injections are often helpful in integrative cancer care), but unfortunately is often deficient in our diet. Within the DMSO community, sodium selenite is used (often in conjunction with iodine or vitamin E suppositories) to treat prostate issues (e.g., by applying it to the perineum) along with thyroid issues and cancer—with equal parts of the 0.013% sodium selenite solution diluting pure DMSO down to 50%.
Note: a common target for selenium is to get 300mcg of it a day. Additionally, one rat study found DMSO increased the respiratory excretion of selenium after the consumption of radio-labeled sodium selenite, which could potentially be quite useful for individuals with impaired respiratory function (e.g., COPD) as the body utilizes the lung excretion to reduce toxic selenium levels. In another sheep study, DMSO, when given to selenium-deficient sheep (without supplemental selenium) it increased their likilhood of developing a selenium deficiency disease (white muscle disease).

•Boron—Boron (specifically borax) is also combined with DMSO to treat fungal infections (e.g., skin or nail infections and intestinal candida infections). In this use, typically a solution of 6 grams of borax dissolved in 1 liter of water mixed with equal parts DMSO to create a 50% solution.
Note: borax has long been used as an alternative treatment for arthritis, but I have not come across this application within the DMSO community.

•Baking Soda—Many potential therapeutic applications exist here (e.g., for cancer), but excluding a few cases where it was used to treat gout (by neutralizing uric acid) and being mixed into certain DMSO preparations and IVs (at 4.2-8.4%), frequently for the purpose of neutralizing another strong acid in the mixture, this combination has not been explored.

•Zinc Citrate—we find zinc deficiencies are one of the most common issues we encounter in patients. As such, I felt it was noteworthy that zinc citrate (500mg a day) is used in the DMSO community for general longevity, in part because DMSO helps transport it into cells (which can often be a challenge with zinc and part of why substances that facilitate this, such as hydroxychloroquine, are clinically efficacious).

•Lithium Orotate—In lower doses, lithium has a variety of neuroprotective qualities and is quite helpful for certain psychiatric conditions, particularly anxiety. When combined with DMSO at lower doses (5-15mg of lithium a day), the DMSO community has found it helps with energy levels (e.g., in chronic fatigue syndrome, burnout, depression), improves mood, and may protect against neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s or dementia. Conversely, they advise being aware of lithium toxicity from higher doses (e.g., arrhythmias or dizziness)—an issue which likely emerges due to excessive doses combined with DMSO’s potentiating qualities.

•Cesium Chloride—this used to be widely used for alternative cancer care, but since there were some challenges with taking it orally, a few physicians then combined it with DMSO for a topical administration (e.g., 1 g in 10 mL DMSO once a day) or potentiated IV administration (due to DMSO transporting it across the blood brain barrier). Remarkable results were in turn reported, such as a brain cancer patient had a tumor pressing against an optic nerves, and within 15 minutes, could feel the effect of the treatment as the optic nerve was rapidly decompressed.
Note: with this combination, it was advised to have medical supervision and to monitor the heart for arrhythmias.

Natural Metabolites
Many different natural metabolites (e.g., acids and sugars) combine well with DMSO, and in many cases, have been reported to provide rather remarkable restorative effects to the body:

•Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF)—5-HMF is a relatively unknown compound formed from the dehydration of sugars, which exists in small amounts in honey, dried fruits, and caramelized foods, is present in some traditional remedies (e.g., licorice), and is produced from things like straw and bran through a tempering process similar to malting beer. It selectively scavenges reactive nitrogen species (whereas DMSO selectively scavenges hydroxyl radicals), so in theory, together they eliminate many key sources of oxidative stress for the mitochondria and increase their oxidative metabolism (whereas other non-selective antioxidants can interfere with that).

As 5-HMF has been successfully used as an energy improving mitochondrial support (e.g., it is the active ingredient in this supplement), the German DMSO field explored mixing the two together (and provided a 30% formulation of it with DMSO here, which contains roughly 30mg 5-HMF in each drop).
Note: this mixture is dosed at 5-20 drops 1-3 times a day, with lower doses (5-10 drops) used for CSF (as sensitive patients can get overloaded with higher doses), 10 drops for typical uses (e.g., acute needs or a general preventative) and 20 drops for those who respond best to that dose or acute needs where the individual is unlikely to be sensitive (e.g., depressive episodes rather than CFS).

They found this combination was extremely effective for fatigue (e.g., CFS). Also, it helped a variety of related conditions (e.g., burnout, PTSD, physical trauma, post-operative recovery) and associated sources of chronic stress (e.g., cancer, chronic infections, renal failure etc.). Likewise, improved athletic performance, psychological resilience (due to its improvement of pain, insomnia, brain fog, and fatigue), and handling stressful jobs were observed from this mixture. In short, effective CFS remedies are quite rare, so the reported successes with 5-HMF DMSO (e.g., energy levels being restored after a few months of it) are quite noteworthy.

Note: it is advised to supplement this with essential mitochondrial minerals (e.g., magnesium, selenium and boron), not permanently rely upon it (instead focus on gradually restoring gut and mitochondrial health) and to not consume within 2 hours of an oxidizing agent (as 5-HMF, like furfural is easily oxidized)—although in many cases, oxidizing agents are needed to restore mitochondrial health (hence the need to space them out). Conversely, when mixed in DMSO, 5-HMF (and furfural) is resistant to less potent oxidation (e.g., from the air) and hence can be stored for a long time.

Lastly, 30% 5-HMF with 70% DMSO (dabbed on once a day and left for 30 minutes) has also been reported to sometimes help spider veins.

•Lactic Acid—Lactic acid is a metabolic byproduct formed when sugar is metabolized without the mitochondria (e.g., because there is no more oxygen available) and is commonly associated with the muscle burn experienced during exercise (when energy demands exceed what the mitochondria can produce).

Many pieces of evidence suggest that periodically putting the body under moderate amounts of stress triggers an adaptive process that improves health (termed hormesis). Many proven holistic therapies (e.g., exercise, saunas or ozone therapy) are thought to function through this mechanism, and lactic acid has been identified as one of the possible agents that facilitates this beneficial response.

Separately, a German doctor Waltraut Fryda MD, concluded cancer arose from an adrenaline deficiency (resulting from chronic overproduction of adrenaline), which led to cells becoming unable to expel excess sugar, at which point the cells became cancerous to metabolize the sugar (discussed further here and here). She then concluded that the lactic acid produced would switch from the D-isomer (D-lactic acid) to the L-isomer (L-lactic acid) when this process is initiated, and that providing 21% D-lactic acid (dextrorotatory lactic acid) could help reverse this process and treat cancer.

Both of these inspired the German DMSO community to explore combining either using drops of 21% D-lactic acid as a salad dressing (rather than vinegar) or combining it (or magnesium lactate) with DMSO. They then found that lactic acid is excellent for:

1. Connective tissue disorders (e.g., weak collagen). Here, 1 tsp magnesium lactate is mixed with 2tsp DMSO in a (10 ounce) glass of water (or another beverage) and consumed throughout the day.
Note: this has also been explored for reducing arterial deposits.

2. To treat varicose veins, often in combination with MgCl (e.g., 7ml DMSO plus 3ml 12% MgCl₂, plus 1g magnesium lactate).
Note: depending on sensitivity, 30-70% DMSO is used here.

3. As a spray to improve skin tone and vitality (e.g., 5 parts 100% DMSO plus 3 parts 12% MgCl₂ plus 2 parts 21% D-lactic acid). Additionally, the MgCl₂ concentration is sometimes increased for pigment disorders (e.g., 3 parts DMSO, 6 parts MgCl₂, 1 part lactic acid).
Note: sometimes seawater is used in place of MgCl₂ (e.g., for healing acne scars).

4. Eliminating body fat (e.g., lipidemia), using the previously described methods.

5. Eliminate lymphatic stagnation (lymphedema), typically done with the MgCl₂ skin tone spray.

6. Healing wounds (where the MgCl₂ spray is again used). This is also utilized in dentistry for post-implant complications to ensure healing and the implant remaining viable (where it is typically applied with injection rather than a spray).
Note: DMSO mixed with magnesium lactate is also often injected or infused to assist with healing non-healing wounds or dental issues (e.g., with implants, tooth extractions or bone regeneration).

7. As a topical spray to treat fungal infections (e.g., 30% DMSO, 30-50% of a 21% D-lactic acid solution, 20-40% of a colloidal silver solution.

8. Improving gut dysbiosis (where 20-30 drops of lactic acid is used as a salad dressing 1-2 times a day).
Note: in this application, I do not believe it is mixed with DMSO.

Of these, the cosmetic and connective tissue strengthening applications are the most popular.

•Galactose—Lactose (the sugar in milk) is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose was adopted by the DMSO community after they learned it reduced insulin resistance (by providing an alternate source of cellular sustenance), that it improved neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, [a disease characterized by insulin resistance], and hepatic encephalopathy), and that neurons could use it to synthesize amino acids. Typically, it is administered by mixing half a teaspoon of DMSO mixed with a heaped teaspoon of galactose in a glass of water and then slowly sipping that mixture throughout the day (particularly when hungry). Additionally, sometimes infusions of this combination are used for neurodegenerative diseases.
Note: it is also being explored for peripheral nerve damage, sleep disorders, and muscle weakness.

•Honey—Treats skin rashes (lower legs) with antimicrobial effects, applied topically.

•Apple Cider Vinegar—Used to treat skin rashes and infections.
Note: research (detailed above) has shown vinegar combinations treat fungal infections.

•Sodium Gluconate—as there is a bit of data suggesting sodium gluconate can improve tissue regeneration in amphibians, this combination has been explored for healing acute injuries (e.g., to the face) and for surgical recovery, such as with a 100ml spray containing 15mL sodium gluconate, 10ml DMSO, and 75ml water.

•Allantoin—This compound is recognized to promote tissue regeneration, and when combined with DMSO, has been reported to enhance scar healing and restore nerve sensitivity and tissue flexibility

•Hyaluronic acid—this is primarily used in cosmetic applications (either topically or injected), while conversely, if too much is injected, it can be corrected by topically applying DMSO with hyaluronic acid (resulting in a better cosmetic result than the uneven effect from injecting it). It has also been used alongside heparin to enhance the potency of intravesical infusions of interstitial cystitis. Finally, as many knee patients benefit from hyaluronic acid injections into the knees, but often can’t do so due to the cost of those injections (specifically vials of sterile hyaluronic acid), I suspect topical applications of this formulation could provide an affordable alternative for them.
Note: hyaluronic acid is larger than the typical molecular size DMSO can transport, so I am not certain if topical applications of this combination “work.”

•Dichloroacetic acid (DCA)—There is some data showing DCA treats cancer by altering cancer metabolism by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (forcing them to switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation), which reduces cancer growth and can trigger apoptosis, and it is still viewed as experimental; some alternative doctors use it as a cancer therapy. Typically, this mixture is ingested, with DCA being dosed at 300-2000mg a day (1500 being the most common dose), with initial doses recommended to be on the low end, after which it is diluted in 400ml water and can be mixed with 1-5ml of DMSO. With this combination, the central issue is DCA’s acidity, so it must be neutralized with baking soda before consumption (e.g., acid is mixed with 100 ml of water and baking soda until the pH normalizes or a gaseous reaction stops). Interestingly, while this combination is exclusive to the German DMSO community, one American physician recently contacted me about using this mixture topically for a skin cancer, which illustrates the self emergent nature of DMSO knowledge once individuals understand the foundational pieces.
Note: sources say to take 50-150 mg/kg a day of DCA (which is a much higher dose than the one I found listed above). IV infusions (e.g., 1-2 g DCA in 500ml saline) are sometimes also used.

•Furfural—This substance (which is similar to 5-HMF) was used in the past by a forgotten Austrian doctor (Drobil) to treat cancer. Hence, the DMSO community tried this combination for cancer and has reported some positive results from topical applications or oral ones (e.g., bladder cancer). Presently, it’s formulated as a 30% solution, and dosed at 20 drops 3 times a day.
Note: these preliminary results (and 5-HMF’s properties) suggest 5-HMF could have value in cancer, but this has never been tested.

•Humic Acids—these are sometimes combined with DMSO to improve the gut microbiome.

Amino Acids and Neurotransmitters
•GABA—GABA (the main inhibitory neurotransmitter) has significant synergy with DMSO as typically, less than 1% of the GABA you ingest can get into the brain (which has led to many studies arguing GABA supplements are a scam that do very little1,2). However, with DMSO, significant effects are noticed, highlighting DMSO’s ability to bring things across the blood brain barrier.
Note: I have seen sensitive patients experience fairly strong effects (including withdrawals—a common issue with substances that affect the GABA system) from liposomal GABA preparations, which argues that formulation can bring things into the brain. As such, a theoretical risk exists for developing a GABA addiction from combining it with DMSO, but I have never come across any reports of this. Rather, the only issue reported is that it can make you sleepy and hence is best before bed.

GABA combinations, in turn, are commonly used for improving sleep, neurodegenerative disorders and behavioral or learning issues in children (especially ADD), with many adolescents having significantly improved determination, sense of order, focus, and memory. Additionally, it is also sometimes used for epilepsy, and I suspect also used for anxiety (but I have never come across this being done). Finally, GABA is sometimes infused or subcutaneously injected with DMSO (typically 0.5 grams of GABA in 10 ml of 0.9% NaCl with 10 ml of 15% DMSO).

•Amino Acids—Down Syndrome was repeatedly found to respond to DMSO alone or in conjunction with amino acids and a few different formulations for this were studied such as DMSO with gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), gamma amino beta hydroxybutyric acid (GABOB), and acetyl glutamine (with lower doses given to those under 3 1⁄2 years of age). Of these approaches, the most popular approach was an injectable DMSO amino acid mixture known as Merinex (which was used in multiple studies).

I long wondered what was in it and eventually found out from Harmut Fischer::

We were able to track down the amino acid mixture "Merinex" mentioned in the book with the help of a reader in Chile, but oh dear, this ready-made medicine contains so many undesirable additives that I wouldn't give it to children, teenagers, or adults. Mixing it yourself is more fun anyway.

The mixture he then settled on was 5g (one heaped teaspoon) of 8 of the 9 essential amino acids (histidine is skipped), 2g of GABA and 1 tablespoon of DMSO in a glass of water (or smoothie or porridge) 2-3 times a day between meals with N-acetylglutamate also often being added (and the total dose typically halved for children). Later, he also concluded adding galactose to the amino acid mixture (1 or 2 teaspoons total each day, and preferably taken after meals) further enhanced this regimen, found the ideal amino acid dose ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 teaspoons (depending on age and weight) with half a tsp of magnesium lactate sometimes also added in.

Additionally, while this mixture is often taken orally, it can also be applied topically (e.g., on the neck), or split with the amino acids being swallowed while DMSO (30% or 60%) is instead topically sprayed onto alternating wide regions of the body (e.g., stomach, back, legs) and left undisturbed for 30 minutes. Lastly, topical DMSO is often used for younger children (e.g., a toddler might receive a glass of water with a heaped teaspoon of amino acids alongside a topical DMSO spray).
Note: if there are other medications, they should be taken at least an hour away from DMSO.

As the studies here show, in addition to Down syndrome, this mixture has been used with success in learning disabilities, developmental delays, mood and anxiety disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases—of which minor or severe learning disabilities are the most common application. For example, Fischer cited, a much simpler regimen (1 teaspoon of DMSO and 1 heaped teaspoon of amino acid powder once a day) was able to make a child be more focused, alert and “pay much better attention at school,” something many other parents have also observed after using this formulation on their children (e.g., they become better at completing tasks).

Note: in one hamster study, higher concentrations of oral DMSO were found to inhibit intestinal L-alanine transportation (with partial inhibition at 0.3M and complete inhibition at 1M) indicating that high doses of oral DMSO may not be able address intestinal malabsorption cases (whereas there was a report in the early DMSO literature where topical DMSO mixed with needed nutrients provided critical nutrition to someone unable to absorb food through the stomach).

•Glutamine—this is sometimes used at the time of an injury, trauma or serious illness to accelerate healing from it (with typically 5 grams being taken with DMSO when the illness strikes), and for more protracted illnesses to prevent muscle wasting.

•Glycine—this amino acid is sometimes utilized to counteract premature signs of aging, enhance growth hormone release, promote muscle building, facilitate collagen synthesis, and assist in recovery from injury.

Note: we often find amino acid infusions to be quite helpful, especially for older patients.

•Taurine—this amino acid is sometimes added to DMSO eye drops to support energy production and cell regeneration in photoreceptor cells.
Note: taurine has also been shown to do this for the hair cells of the ears, but I have not seen a combination with it for hearing.

•Melatonin—this combination significantly increases parasympathetic tone (something many are lacking in) and helps the body transition into the sleeping phase so it can best restore and regenerate itself (something many are also lacking in)—which often translates to it being easier to get to sleep and the nerves feeling much calmer and smoother.

Note: the immunological and psychological benefits of this combination have been observed to increase if the mixture is used between the end of September to the end of March.

This mixture is normally taken at the end of the day. When applied, it is typically a 1 or 5% solution that has been diluted in DMSO and water (so each drop contains 0.5mg or 2.5mg of melatonin), after which about 1-6 drops are applied to one of the soft areas of the body (e.g., back of knees, inner thighs, abdomen, inner forearms), or they are sprayed into the nose or taken orally. Significant opinions exist on the correct dose, so it is advisable to begin with the 1% solution and only consider switching to the 5% if a higher volume of drops becomes necessary.

Note: while there are immense benefits to what is being described here (especially since melatonin is a signal for the brain to open its glymphatic drainage and heal itself—something needed in many chronic illnesses), I believe this remedy is better to take intermittently as the potential exists for it to downregulate endogenous melatonin production. The closest equivalent to this we have tried (Davinci liposomal melatonin) is very helpful, but for those reasons, we typically only use it when it’s needed (e.g., after disrupting the circadian rhythm after a 24 hour shift or flying into another timezone, on nights where it’s very hard to sleep, or in someone healing a complex neurological disorder).

Oxidative Therapies
The oxidative therapies (e.g., ozone, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide) are some of the most effective (and easily available) integrative antimicrobial therapies, so they naturally lend themselves to being mixed with DMSO. However, there is a significant drawback: because DMSO is oxidized into MSM and acts as an antioxidant, combining it with an oxidizing therapy can reduce the effectiveness of both, as they partially neutralize each other.

This is best illustrated by ozone (three oxygen molecules bonded together), the most reactive oxidative therapy and for decades has been widely used throughout the integrative medicine field for a wide range of conditions (with many of the effects overlapping with what is seen from ultraviolet blood irradiation—a therapy which creates ozone within the blood and which I summarized all the remarkable evidence of here).

For years, I heard that DMSO and ozone should never be mixed and given together, either because of the inactivation issue or because one of the breakdown products of ozone decomposing DMSO in wastewater was formaldehyde (although it is not a primary breakdown product). However, ozone is rapidly consumed after reacting with blood, and its biological impact comes primarily from the oxidized compounds it forms. Therefore, if you wish to combine ozone with other therapies, they must be administered at different times.

For example, early in the COVID pandemic, hospitals in Italy and China discovered that ozone treatment could help with the infection. It was quickly adopted by hospitals around the world (excluding those within America), and a significant amount of evidence accumulated in support of the therapy. Lance Grindle, a doctor familiar with both DMSO and ozone (the same one I previously highlighted, who spent decades exploring the use of DMSO and hematoxylin for cancer), shared with me that:

At our rural Quito clinic we tried to make a difference in the pandemic early May 2020 with MAH [infusing ozonated blood] ending up with rapidly infusing 150-180 ml heparinized blood at 55mcg (and later 70mcg) of ozone then waited 45 minutes and infused DMSO in a 250ml saline solution. This worked very well—of 100 patients with very serious stats (e.g., poor X-Rays and Oxygen Saturations plus Ferritins 500-1800 and Dimer-D up to the 15.000s), none went into ER nor required intubation and none later reported long covid.

Many patients either near the end of the treatment or shortly after spontaneously said that 'they felt as if a weight had been lifted from their shoulders' which was accompanied by immediate improvement in pulse oxygenation. A minority of patients warranted a second treatment the following day but none required repeating the initial treatment or a third MAH.

The results Dr. Grindle got here were better than what many others reported for similar scenarios where ozone was used alone, which is likely due to the numerous therapeutic effects DMSO had on COVID (e.g., it cures ARDS, a central component of the COVID-19 disease process), and that by having a small spacing between them, he was able to mitigate the issues from combining these two therapies.
Note: alternating between applying DMSO and an oxidative therapy is another popular approach (e.g., for coughs, colds, and tonsillitis), particularly since it prevents prolonged contact between DMSO and the oxidizing agent.

The other oxidative therapies combined with DMSO are less reactive than ozone. As such, if they only temporarily contact DMSO, both will retain their functionality and their primary breakdown product is simply oxidized DMSO (MSM). Because of this, while they can be combined and do work, ideally, the mixing should be done as soon as possible to the time of application or they should be applied sequentially (with the oxidative therapy being applied first and then DMSO 3-5 minutes later, although in some cases this can be reversed, such as for applying CDS to skin where there is an infection below or for fungal infections. Likewise, they should always be stored in separate bottles to prevent any accidental inactivation.
Note: at lower concentrations (e.g., in a glass to drink or IVs) these reactions proceed quite slowly (so DMSO and the oxidizing agent can be readily mixed together)—but they nonetheless should be taken immediately after being mixed.

Conversely, there is significant synergy between the oxidative therapies, as DMSO greatly enhances their ability to penetrate throughout the body and reach their target, while DMSO can simultaneously protect normal tissue from oxidative stress. Because of this, many have been able to cure otherwise incurable infections (e.g., chronic wounds, Lyme disease, recurrent shingles, and post-viral syndromes) with some of these combinations while others have used them to successfully treat cancer.
Note: one reason oxidative therapies are thought to address post-viral syndromes (e.g., fatigue, brain fog, loss of smell) is because they eliminate antigen-antibody complexes.

Hydrogen Peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is one of oldest oxidative therapies, and hence for decades has been one of the most explored DMSO combinations, particularly since there is a consistent strong therapeutic synergy between them (e.g., they can create localized oxidative bursts to eliminate pathogens) and H₂O₂’s reactive rate with DMSO (which also produces MSM) is slow enough that they can briefly be together. If at all possible, (diluted) food-grade hydrogen peroxide should be used as standard H₂O₂ contains stabilizers that are best avoided in the body.

Note: as the effects of H₂O₂ (and its tissue toxicity) are concentration dependent, it is important to use lower concentrations (e.g., 3-6% is commonly suggested, particularly in sensitive areas like the face—which seems on the high end to me). Likewise, when drinking hydrogen peroxide, it is important to use very low concentrations (e.g., 10-20 drops of 3% H₂O₂ in a glass of water with DMSO), and ideally, to have it 1-2 times a day far away from meals to avoid reactions in the GI system (e.g., authors advise at least 30 minutes before or 3 hours after meals). Every once in a while, I hear about someone who accidentally drinks mislabeled 35% food-grade hydrogen peroxide—do not be that person.

DMSO and H₂O₂ hence, help with a variety of infections:

•Persistent Infections—I’ve come across many cases of infections that did not respond to numerous natural or conventional treatments that were treated with DMSO plus H₂O₂ (either orally, nebulized, infused, or topically), such as Lyme, leishmaniasis, and recurrent bacterial lung infections.
Note: when nebulizing hydrogen peroxide, a much lower concentration needs to be nebulized (e.g., 1-2 ml or 20-40 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide in a 20 ml saline solution, and 1-10% DMSO—typically on the lower end). It’s also frequently advised to alternate between nebulizing DMSO and an oxidizing agent to prevent them from gradually reacting with each other in the nebulizer.

•Hepatitis C—while other forms might work, in reports I’ve come across, IV infusions were used. For reference, DMSO peroxide infusions are typically 50ml of 15% DMSO, 1.5g of MgCl₂, 5ml of 3% H₂O₂ in 500ml saline (for a final H₂O₂ concentration of 0.03-0.06%) dripped over 90 minutes. Additionally, for Hepatitis C treatment, other oxidizing agents are sometimes also added in.
Note: UVBI has been shown to treat Hepatitis C.

•Wound Healing—Hydrogen peroxide has long been used for acute and chronic wound treatment. When combined with DMSO, many have found that wound healing is significantly improved (however, nurses have avoided discussing it due to regulatory restrictions). This combination in turn has been used for many chronic human and animal wounds where all other treatments had failed (e.g., those from vessels damaged by chronic smoking, diabetic ulcers or open leg sores, surgical wounds or pressure ulcers).

One common protocol for chronic wounds is spraying 3% H₂O₂, followed in 3 minutes by 30-60% DMSO diluted with MgCl₂ (along with keeping the wound exposed to the air), with lower DMSO concentrations being used if stitches are present (as DMSO can react with them). In some cases, colloidal silver is also added in or hydrogen peroxide (if too irritating) is substituted with iodine, or a 3% hydrogen peroxide gel (with 5-10% DMSO) is used.

•Bites—DMSO is often extremely helpful for itching bites. However, in cases where they are inflamed (and quite itchy), spraying 3% H₂O₂ on beforehand improves DMSO’s ability to treat the issue.

•Fungal Infections—Fungi (e.g., molds) are quite sensitive to oxidizing agents. As a result, many topical DMSO treatments use them either alone or in combination with others (e.g., the previously mentioned lactic acid colloidal silver antifungal spray can subsequently have any of the oxidizing therapies described in this section applied as well).

•Bladder Infections—Dilute solutions (e.g., 20 drops of 3% H₂O₂ and 20 ml DMSO in 150 ml water) are sometimes drunk for bladder infections. One German gynecologist has reported vaginal douches (e.g. 40% DMSO) to treat a variety of gynecologic issues (e.g., infections, scarring, and endometrial abnormalities), and in some cases, adding hydrogen peroxide enhances the effects (e.g., an intravesical administration of 20 drops of 3% H₂O₂ and 20ml DMSO in 150mL water).
Note: since colloidal silver is eliminated through the urine and resists degradation during that time, it is often used for infections of the urinary tract.

•Epstein–Barr virus—While I suspect DMSO-H₂O₂ would treat chronic EBV (as many have found ozone does), I am not sure if it does, as we typically use UVBI for that, and I have not found reports of this being done. However, I have come across numerous cases of it treating acute EBV (mono) where it is either applied topically to the neck, drank 3 times a day (in a glass of water with 10-20 drops of DMSO, 15 drops 3% H₂O₂) or nebulized.

•Dental Infections—For periodontitis and tooth infections, spraying undiluted oxidative therapy (e.g., 1.5-3% H₂O₂ or CDS) onto the affected area and then applying 12-50% DMSO onto it (e.g., with a pipette or cotton swab) and then gently massaging it in often provides immediate and dramatic relief. Mouthwashes (e.g., 20 drops of 3% H₂O₂ added to a 15% DMSO—although higher H₂O₂ concentrations are also used) are often used for less severe issues (including blisters and pustules on the tongue), and direct mixtures (e.g., 2 parts DMSO 1 part 3% H2O2) are sometimes used for jaw abscesses.
Note: Ozonated water, CDS, or artemisia are often added to DMSO mouthwashes, and DMSO diluted with MgCl₂ is sometimes used for dental issues (while conversely H₂O₂ is often added to MgCl-DMSO preparations for ailing implants).

•Ear Infections—Many have reported that DMSO helps ear inflammation and middle ear infections, with 1-2 drops of 3% peroxide put into the ear (with them lying on their side the ear faces up), followed by 15% DMSO being put into the ear for 5-10 minutes, being the most common approach. When a significant infection is present other antimicrobials (e.g., artemisia) are added too.
Note: MgCl₂ is often also used for ear canal inflammation.

•Nose Infections—This combination is also used for nose infections (e.g., with alternating DMSO and peroxide drops). However, since the nasal mucosa is sensitive to peroxide, lower concentrations should be used (e.g., nose drops should use 1% H₂O₂ and mouthwashes should be made with 3% peroxide diluted to 0.3%).
Note: one physician shared with me that for nasal infections, rhinitis, and polyps, 10% DMSO followed by CDS 3-5 minutes later, along with twice daily nasal glutathione, has been very helpful for congestion.

DMSO and hydrogen peroxide can also help a variety of non-infectious conditions.

•Skin Care—Hydrogen peroxide has also been used to enhance DMSO’s anti-aging properties. For the skin, it’s been reported to improve skin hydration and microcirculation when used topically, orally, or in a bath (where DMSO is applied to the skin beforehand rather than putting a lot into a bathtub). It also works quite well for acne (3% H₂O₂ followed by 30-50% DMSO sprayed on the affected area), blackheads, and pimples (apply 3% H₂O₂ followed by point applications of 70% DMSO).
Note: this combination is reported to clear acne much faster than conventional treatments, as it also addresses what is under the skin. An alternate regimen that has also worked quite well is 20-30% DMSO sprayed on, followed by CDS sprayed on, which is then allowed to dry (overnight causes a dramatic reduction in inflammatory papules and gradual clearing).

•Skin Growths—Topical applications of high concentrations of H₂O₂ have been repeatedly reported to treat skin cancers. In turn, lower ones combined with topical DMSO have treated a variety of cancerous and non-cancerous growths. These include moles and warts (12% H₂O₂ followed by 60%-100% DMSO that can be diluted in MgCl₂), genital warts (which are also treated with DMSO-CDS), mouth ulcers and herpes lesions (3-12% H₂O₂ followed by 60%-100% DMSO)

Note: as some moles are melanomas, DMSO with rose bengal may also eliminate some or all of these growths (but to the best of my knowledge this has not been explored). Additionally, many of the above conditions also respond to pure DMSO without H₂O₂.

•Circulation—oxidative therapies also improve circulation (e.g., they reduce blood viscosity), increase alveoli uptake of oxygen and improve blood oxygenation—which DMSO also does, so as a result, this combination (or even DMSO while breathing concentrated oxygen) has been used for a variety of cardiovascular issues.

These include peripheral artery disease, varicose veins (where many other combinations are also used), vascular deposits and chemotherapy arterial damage (15 drops of H₂O₂ plus 0.5-2 tsp of DMSO in a glass of water 1-3 times a day), and large thrombi (by applying various DMSO combinations of heparin H₂O₂ and CDS onto the skin above it)

Note: numerous studies have shown that, like DMSO, ozone, or UVBI improve stroke recovery, and as a result, some DMSO doctors have incorporated H₂O₂ into their heart attack or stroke recovery infusions. Similarly, DMSO and H₂O₂ or CDS are often used to treat blood pressure (likely in part due to their reducing the viscosity of the blood).

Lastly, DMSO-H₂O₂ is often also mixed with other substances to eliminate infections such as CDS, Artemisia, colloidal silver, or methylene blue (for parasites) or magnesium chloride to assist in healing the affected area.

Chlorine Dioxide
In many ways, chlorine dioxide (ClO₂ or CDS) behaves similarly to H₂O₂, but as it has more recently come into vogue, the DMSO field has more experience with H₂O₂ combinations. For reference, MMS (Miracle Mineral Solution) is the liquid formed by mixing sodium chlorite and an acid, which produces a gas; when this gas is captured in another liquid, such as water, it is known as CDS.
Note: in many cases, when “CDS” is said, MMS is actually what’s being described.

Within the ozone field, people are surprisingly territorial about which way is “best” to administer ozone (e.g., some strongly advocate for directly injecting ozone gas into the veins, others for withdrawing blood, ozonating it, and re-infusing it—the approach I’ve long advocated for). Within the CDS field, a similar situation exists and I have listened to numerous debates where individuals strongly insisted their approach was the way CDS must be done. The three perspectives are as follows:

•Just consume sodium chlorite, as ClO₂ is rapidly transformed back to sodium chlorite in the body and only “activates” in acidic compartments of the body (e.g., low-oxygen areas where diseases are), so everything else people do is a waste of time (as they believe sodium chlorite is the actual active agent). This argument is supported by the fact that most of the research on CDS comes from sodium chlorite studies (where it alone worked as a disinfectant)—all of which Pierre Kory discussed further here. Conversely, however, in Jim Humble’s original work with MMS, he (and others) noticed that sodium chlorite alone would treat about 70% of malaria cases, whereas once combined with an acid, it would treat 100% of them.

•Use the MMS mixture, sodium chlorite and an acid, and then directly apply it topically or ingest it (which is the approach most of my network uses and has the most familiarity with). This has the advantage of being simple to do and effective, but the disadvantage of sometimes causing reactions. I personally believe the reactions are either due to too high a dose being used (as regardless of what you tell people, many will start with higher doses) and issues with the specific acid used to activate sodium chlorite. Citric, the most common, will cause reactions in some people (which may be related to the fact that citric acid is produced from black mold), while hydrochloric acid (HCl) does so much more rarely (but is often not used because it’s harder to obtain than citric acid powder).

Fischer in turn brought two interesting points to this perspective. First, when higher concentrations of HCl are used, it can cause unwanted byproducts to form, so he advocates for 4% HCl rather than 10% HCl as the activator. Second, MMS (unlike CDS) will be acidic due to the acid activator present, and as such, like other acid-containing DMSO mixtures, some will have difficulty tolerating it once it is mixed with DMSO (e.g., Fischer cites cases of individuals who could not tolerate MMS-DMSO in the ear canal who were fine with CDS-DMSO in an infected ear canal and then recovered from CDS-DMSO).

•Use CDS (water mixed with activated MMS so ClO₂ is trapped within it). The upside to this approach is that it is less likely to cause reactions (which has been used as the basis to aggressively promote it), and hence Fischer’s preferred approach for topical DMSO and IVs. The downside is that there is a lot of ambiguity with standardizing doses, as this will be affected by how long the drops are allowed to react before being mixed with water and likewise, how much water is mixed with them. In the time I’ve looked into it, while I have come across a few protocols with standardized doses and alleged CDS concentrations, as best as I can gather, this has not been clearly worked out. As such, many people I’ve spoken to simply start at a low dose (e.g., a drop of MMS mixed with a set amount of water) and then gradually increase the dose until someone no longer tolerates it, with the amount of water used normally being decided by how much is needed to eliminate the taste of CDS from the water.
Note: Fischer highlighted extensive research (I confirmed exists) which points out that CDS lasts much longer in solutions if it is created with lactic acid rather than the standard activators. As such, his successful results with CDS solutions and DMSO, may in part be due to using 21% D-lactic acid with sodium chlorite rather than citric acid or hydrochloric acid (and likewise, it’s entirely possible the “CDS” solutions used are largely sodium chlorite).

Given all of that, I’ve tried to look through the existing protocols (and had many correspondences) and at this point, the ones that approach to work include:

•Mix 25% sodium chlorite solution and 21% (+)-lactic acid drops in a 1-1 ratio in a glass beaker, let it react for 3-5 minutes, and then fill the beaker with purified water.
Note: this creates stabilized CDS (which is not irritating and the only form used in IVs), but the dosing is less clear with it, as exact amounts of water and the drops are rarely provided.

•Activating 10 sodium chlorite drops with 10 drops of an appropriate acid, waiting 15-60 seconds, add 1-2 tsp of DMSO and a bit of water, then immediately applying to a large region of skin (as with more than a 15 second delay, potency is lost).
Note: in cancer protocols, this is done every 1-2 hours for 3 days.

•Simply alternate between drinking CDS and DMSO (which is often what Pierre Kory does).

•Applying DMSO to the feet, waiting a few minutes, then soaking in a foot bath (e.g., one of 20 drops of sodium chlorite activated with an acid).

•Applying MMS to the skin (e.g., 2 drops in 10ml water), and then immediately applying DMSO on top (with it done to larger areas for systemic issues).

•Activating 1-3 drops of MMS, add 100ml of water, and then 1-3 drops of DMSO (one drop for each drop of sodium chlorite), and immediately drink.

•Applying sodium chlorite to a nail infection, then activating it by putting the affected area in an (anti-fungal) 21% lactic acid bath for a few minutes.

•Nebulize DMSO (3 drops 99% DMSO in 2.5mL saline or distilled water), wait 5 minutes, nebulize 2.5mL CDS, 25-35ppm (3 activated MMS drops in 120mL).

In turn, I’ve seen a variety of applications for this combination. For example, rinsing with it is often used for tooth infections, which this reader and this reader (who brushed with it) reported worked for them. Likewise, it’s been used for prostatitis (applied to the perineum), mites (at higher doses). Additionally, I’ve seen numerous reports of it healing severe conditions in animals (e.g., laminitis in a horse or kidney failure in a cat).

Conversely, if all of that is too confusing, many of the same results can simply be obtained with H₂O₂.

Additional Oxidative Therapies
There are a few other oxidative therapies that have also shown significant value in combination with DMSO.

Artemisia annua (wormwood)—This herb (used to treat malaria) contains a variety of endoperoxides (e.g., artemisinin), which under certain biological conditions release reactive oxygen species. Because of this, the herb provides a slow and sustained oxidative therapy and is used in a variety of antimicrobial botanical formulas and likewise, with DMSO for a variety of parasitic (e.g., Babesia), viruses (e.g., warts, flu, COVID-19 or EBV), fungal infections (e.g., in the nails) and bacterial illnesses (e.g., Lyme). Additionally, in combination with DMSO, users report more energy and focus, physical stamina, or better tolerance to cancer treatments (a finding also observed with other oxidative therapies).

As artemisia is more easily absorbed with fat, it is often consumed with fatty meals, or blended with coconut oil (typically as one heaped teaspoon of the herb). However, the best results with artemisia come from an extract made by soaking the herb in DMSO and then consuming the DMSO extract. As such, some individuals will grow the herb at home (which can grow in most temperate regions of the U.S.) so they can make the extract themselves.
Note: DMSO extracts of Cistus incanus, Astragalus, Wild Teasel, Andrographis, and Skullcap are also often used in the treatment of Lyme disease.

Potassium Permanganate—This is a powerful oxidizing agent, which is sometimes topically combined with DMSO (e.g., to treat warts, apply 60% DMSO to the skin, and then apply a 1% potassium permanganate solution). Due to its strength, regardless of the dilution, it should never be swallowed.

Hypochlorous Acid—Hypochlorous acid is a very effective but fairly non-irritating disinfectant. At low concentrations (e.g., 0.01-0.02%), hypochlorous acid is considered safe to apply to the eyes, while at higher concentrations, it is often applied around the eyes (e.g., to the eyelashes). Because of this, I suspect it could be a gentler oxidative therapy to combine with DMSO, but I do not know of anyone who has tried it.

Rizol—This is a combination of ozonated olive oil and ozonated castor oil, along with various essential oils including artemisia, that can be used for infections such as genital warts and fungal infections (by applying it topically a few minutes after DMSO has been applied).

At some point, this product was discovered to be an excellent Lyme disease treatment (e.g., one successful combination was 25 ml of DMSO, 8 drops of 3% H₂O₂, 15 drops of Rizol, and the juice of two organic lemons in 350 ml of water taken 3 times a day for 7 days).
Note: while success continues to be reported with this combination, it is often necessary to start at a much smaller DMSO dose and gradually increase it (e.g., start at 1 teaspoon rather than 5).

Likewise, Deitrich Klinghardt, a very knowledgeable and clinically successful integrative physician who focuses on Lyme disease, became a proponent of this treatment (e.g., he would give 10 drops of it each day to Lyme patients). Because of this, Rizol is sometimes combined with DMSO or an oxidizing agent to treat Lyme disease. Unfortunately, it is not clear which Rizol formulation is used, as the standard one has more essential oils than the two Klinghard used (this one and this one), of which this one is currently his preferred treatment.
Note: DMSO has also been combined with other herbs like stevia for the treatment of Lyme disease.

From a broader vantage, the perspective of the DMSO field has been that DMSO combined with any effective oxidative therapy (of which Rizol is one of many) seems to be the best option for Lyme disease, with H₂O₂ being the most commonly utilized one (either taken orally or in infusions). Additionally, topical DMSO H₂O₂ has been reported to be an effective local treatment for tick bites.

Note: one of the major challenges with treating Lyme disease is that it (and co-infections like Bartonella and Babesia) can hide in places (e.g., inside cells or within biofilms) where antimicrobials can’t reach them. One of the reasons DMSO appears to help treat this condition is because it weakens biofilms and dislodges these microbes from cells and tissues (which has been observed with darkfield microscopy).

Finally, in many cases, the challenge with Lyme is the persistent symptoms it creates, many of which improve with DMSO. In parallel, there have been quite a few reports from individuals who said when they combined their existing Lyme protocol with topical DMSO (for their symptoms), it appeared to enhance the efficacy of their existing treatment and, in some cases, cure the illness.

Oxidizing Cancer
These oxidative combinations have also been repeatedly used for cancer, and there are many reports of significant benefit from them (e.g., some consider DMSO and CDS to be one of the best available home cancer therapies and cancer patients have reported feeling much better by simply taking artemisia DMSO extracts). In turn, a few reasons have been proposed to explain why this:

1. I showed previously that DMSO has many anticancer properties, enhances the efficacy of cancer treatments, and reduces the harm cancer does to the body.

2. Due to their metabolism and lack of antioxidants, cancer cells are more sensitive to oxidative stress. As DMSO allows therapies, such as oxidative ones to penetrate the barriers around cancer cells, a natural synergy exists here.

3. One school of thought (which has some basis for its claim) believes cancer (and autoimmune diseases) arise from microscopic pathogenic bacteria. As those pathogens tend to be highly sensitive to DMSO, oxidative therapies, and UVBI, this is sometimes cited as a reason why those therapies treat cancer and autoimmunity. Since DMSO can bring oxidative therapies into cells, it can eliminate the pathogenic bacteria there and reverse the cancer process.

4. Increasing tissue oxygen (which these combinations do) tends to have anticancer properties.

In turn, I’ve seen the following successful combinations be reported:

•Numerous readers have reported using topical DMSO in combination with CDS to treat cancer.1,2,3,4 One noted that as the top of a breast tumor died, deeper layers would be pushed to the surface and its “connecting strands” were eliminated, while another eliminated a melanoma (which greatly confused the doctors) and shared the supporting pathology report.

•Ozone doctors injecting gaseous ozone or 12% H₂O₂ into superficial tumor areas (such as breast cancer) that have previously been sprayed with 60% DMSO 15 minutes earlier.
Note: similar approaches have also been done with a DMSO artemisia extract or concentrated aqueous chlorine dioxide.

•High doses of oral artemisia (extracted with DMSO) alongside topical applications of DMSO and artemisia on breast metastases cured them.
Note: one German cancer institute determined Artemisia has anticancer properties.

•Hemangiomas (benign tumors of the blood vessels) have been observed to respond to topical applications of 30% DMSO diluted in MgCl₂ with 1 drop of 3% H₂O₂ per ml of the mixture.

Lastly, while vitamin C is an antioxidant, IV vitamin C (which is used to treat cancer) is considered to be an oxidative therapy because at high levels, it catalyzes the production of hydrogen peroxide in the body. Topical DMSO Vitamin C may do that as well (hence why it topically treats cancer) but there is no available data to assess that question.
Note: one reader reported treating their cancer with DMSO and vitamin C.

Dyes
A few different dyes have been combined with DMSO, all of which have shown anticancer activity, along with a few other therapeutic effects:

•Hematoxylin—This is the most effective DMSO cancer therapy I know of, and for that reason, I wrote an extensive article on this remarkable therapy. Since then, I’ve learned the German DMSO community also has had extensive success with this formulation (topically, orally and intravenously), found it’s more practical to prepare the solution and then run it through a millipore filter prior to injection (rather than making a sterile preparation), and that one of its most common uses there is for prostate cancer.

•Rose Bengal—Like hematoxylin, rose bengal is a low cost, relatively non-toxic, century old, water-soluble histology dye that selectively stains cancers (something hematoxylin does once combined with DMSO) that also is given intravenously to measure liver function. After the previously mentioned research showed that injecting 10% rose bengal treated cancer, the DMSO community found this was a rapid, effective, and selective cancer combination (which sometimes also differentiated cancers into normal cells) that could be used for many different cancer types.
Note: when preparing Rose Bengal, it’s important to remember the powder easily stains things.

Typically, it is applied topically in 10–20% DMSO solutions (e.g., 0.1–0.5 mg in 10 mL DMSO), injected into (or subcutaneously around) a tumor (which can only be done for closed tumors), gargled for mouth or throat cancer (approximately 2 drops per swallow), or given intravenously (low doses such as 0.05 mg/kg with DMSO as carrier). When applied topically (either by dripping or dabbing), there will typically be a pink coloration of the area, but this will fade as the dye goes deeper into the tumor (so subsequent applications are normally guided by symptomatic improvement or reapplying once coloration fades).

Note: whereas oral DMSO-hematoxylin frequently treats cancer, oral DMSO-rose bengal has yielded inconsistent results (likely due to it not concentrating within cancer cells), so that route is not typically recommended. Additionally, since it is an ionic compound, it has been theorized that electricity could enhance its delivery to the target site. Finally, while DMSO alone and DMSO-hematoxylin have been nebulized for lung cancer (or lung metastases), I have not been able to find any references to this being done with Rose Bengal.

•Methylene Blue—This dye has recently come into vogue as a mitochondrial support that improves energy levels, alertness, and mood. And to aid in the elimination of infections (along with other benefits like reducing seizures). Over the years, the DMSO community has found that this combination applied topically, also treats cancers (although I suspect not as potently as the other two dies), and through its antimicrobial effects, keeps them from getting infected. Additionally, when combined with DMSO, methylene blue’s positive effects are observed to be potentiated.

Reports from readers here mirror these experiences:

Stage 3 colorectal cancer, I am taking 30mg Ivermectin and 750mg of Fenden per day. I’ve added Methylene Blue Ultra which contains DMSO. My cancer marker dropped from 124.8 to 41.5 and my tumor shrank from 5.4cm to 3.5cm in 6 months. In September I couldn’t even walk to the bathroom without help. Now I’m working at the farm and going back to full time work on 4/21, I am a Brick Mason to give “work” a full perspective.

Everytime I drown into a despondent cycle of no energy, blurred vision, cognitive impairment/ dysfunction, extreme anxiety I take in juice or tea a teaspoon of 99.9% DMSO & two droppers of Blue Methylene, it’s like waking up a zombie, it really livens a broken system.

Note: there are other positive reports for this combination too.

Typically, 0.5-1.0% methylene blue, 10% DMSO solutions are used (with the rest being water). However, one formulation I saw was 0.75g of methylene blue, plus 10ml DMSO plus 20 ml water (which is a much higher concentration). In some cases, this is also mixed with a bit (e.g., 20 drops) of a DMSO Artemisia annua extract. Typically, it is applied as a spray or dabbing, but sometimes it is also gargled (with 10 drops of methylene blue per sip of water), drank, or infused.

•Riboflavin—Riboflavin (B2) and its derivatives are dyes with anticancer (and photodynamic) activity. The DMSO community has also found that they can treat cancer once mixed with DMSO.

Many of these DMSO mixtures are also used in combination. For example:

•Methylene blue, rose bengal, and hematoxylin will often concurrently be applied to tumors (which has been reported to enhance the efficacy of the treatment).

•Many doctors over the years have observed combining IV amygdalin with DMSO and hematoxylin enhances the efficacy of the treatment.

•These three dyes (hematoxylin, Rose Bengal, and methylene blue), as dyes, have specific wavelengths of light they absorb. As such, a homemade version of photodynamic therapy has been explored for them, where a laser (readily available) matching their absorbance spectrum is combined with the DMSO combination and appears to enhance its therapeutic efficacy. For reference, those are hematoxylin—560-590nm, Rose Bengal—540-560nm, and methylene blue—660nm.

Lastly, a variety of DMSO concentrations are used with the dye, although 30% for sensitive skin and 60% for typical cases is commonly used.

Chelating and Detoxifying Agents
DMSO has been found to increase the ability of the following agents to detoxify the body:

•EDTA—Detoxifies heavy metals (lead, cadmium) in neurological conditions (Parkinson’s) and reduces arterial plaque, applied topically or intravenously.
Note: in the past, some American doctors treated cancer, atherosclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis with IV pushes of 20ml of 25% DMSO or 50-100ml of DMSO diluted in 500ml of saline or dextrose mixed with EDTA that was slowly dripped over a three hour period. Likewise, one of the primary people utilizing the DMSO hematoxylin protocols found that concurrently using EDTA often improved the results.

•Chlorella—chlorella is a “gentle” chelator, since it only binds metals already in the gut (preventing them from being reabsorbed), and hence a popular choice in the natural medical field for sensitive patients. When used with DMSO (which draws metals out from deep within the body), chlorella can facilitate a gentle detoxification process (e.g., 5-10 drops of DMSO in a glass of water alongside chlorella). In particularly sensitive cases (e.g., someone with amalgam fillings where there is a risk of further mobilizing toxic metals in the body), chlorella (or another chelating agent) is often given for 2-4 weeks before incorporating DMSO.
Note: activated charcoal (which can bind a range of non-metal toxins in the gut) has also been discussed as a complementary detoxification therapy with DMSO.

•Cilantro—this is a gentle chelating agent which has been used in the natural medicine field to remove mercury, aluminum, lead, and cadmium (with weak evidence it can do so) and hence likely benefits from DMSO’s potentiation.
Note: some individuals also combine DMSO with zeolites for enhanced detoxification.

•Sodium Thiosulfate—DMSO combined with sodium thiosulfate (a treatment for cyanide poisoning) has been successfully used a topical treatment for calcinosis (typically in the skin, but sometimes also the organs and vessels). Typically, it’s made as a topical cream (e.g., 25% sodium thiosulfate, 20% magnesium oxide, 5% DMSO, 50% a base) and applied twice a day, but sometimes also directly injected into the area.
Note: in addition to classic chelators like EDTA, other oral agents (e.g., lactic acid, magnesium lactate or 5-HMF) are sometimes taken orally with DMSO to reduce arterial calcifications.

•DTPA—According to Fischer, in France, 15% DMSO is combined with DTPA and injected along the spine to treat spinal canal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) by reducing vertebral deposits and improving canal patency, and chelating agents are also used in combination with DMSO and shockwave therapy to treat spinal stenosis.

Separately, Fischer has also stated that to treat spinal stenosis he dilutes DMSO to 10% with isotonic saline, and adds 1g of DMSA for each ml (e.g, a 10ml mixture would be 1ml 100% DMSO, 9ml isotonic saline, and 10mg DMSA) which he then neutralizes the acidity of with sodium bicarbonate—after which he injects it subcutaneously on the spine over the affected areas, with the necessary frequency greatly varying.

All of this is quite confusing to me as different chelators were used in each example (with DTPA being much better for removing calcifications) and the chelator normally used to remove calcifications (EDTA) is not used (although he does make a reference to it being an “easier” option), something I can only guess is a result of it being too aggressive of a chelator to use on the spine.

Most importantly, while I am familiar with injecting calcium EDTA to dissolve calcifications (as that provides a non-surgical way to eliminate bone spurs—which is often very useful) I can see a lot of issues with using that approach near the spinal cord, particularly in the manner vaguely described. As such, I felt it was important to include this (as spinal stenosis can be challenging to treat), but simultaneously am anything but certain of its merits.

•Alpha-Lipoic-Acid—ALA (due to its affinity for the CNS) is sometimes used to chelate metal from the brain (but not frequently as there are other stronger chelators). However, it becomes more potent when mixed with DMSO. Additionally, due to its many other therapeutic properties, it's often combined with DMSO for things besides chelation (e.g., one individual recently contacted me about using it to treat chemotherapy induced neuropathy).

•DMPS—Detoxifies heavy metals (mercury, lead) in neurological conditions (Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s) before fasting, applied topically or orally. When DMSO is combined with chelation protocols (e.g., with IV DMPS or EDTA or a gentler home protocol with 50-200mg chelator doses) the best results are obtained when it is used later in the process as a “booster” after the easily accessible metals have already been bound by chelators so DMSO can draw out those within the deeper compartments. Conversely, if it is used initially, there is a risk it can cause too many metals to be drawn out and overwhelm either the liver or kidneys.
Note: in one case that was cited, after successive chelation infusions, the amount of metal in the urine decreased, but once 5mL of DMSO was added to the infusion, it dramatically increased.

•Emeramide—this is a more recently developed chelating agent some individuals are reporting very positive effects with (e.g., I was recently sent this message from an autism group). Parts of the DMSO community have found it works quite well with DMSO, particularly since it is completely soluble in DMSO (e.g., 100mg in a few mL of DMSO).

•Calcium gluconate monohydrate—this binds fluoride, and hence is sometimes combined with DMSO to eliminate it from patients.

•Bentonite Clay—this is sometimes combined with DMSO to bind metals mobilized to the surface of the body.

Note: if DMSO is taken before and during a fast, due to its channel opening properties, it is reported to both assist in the detoxification process (e.g., increase heavy metal excretion) and prevent that process from causing reactions (e.g., Herxing), so some DMSO proponents advocate for using it prior to a fast. Likewise, some authors advocate for taking either DMSO and DMPS or EDTA prior to fasting if there are already neurotoxic metals in the patient or there is already a neurologic condition. DMSO can also be incorporated into a variety of detoxification protocols (e.g., Ayurvedic ones).

Cosmetics
DMSO enhances the delivery of skin-rejuvenating agents in cosmetic applications, often combined with mesotherapy and microneedling (e.g., of vitamin C and hyaluronic acid), manual therapy or ultrasound to improve skin texture, reduce wrinkles, cellulite, and scars, and promote hair growth. Numerous formulations have been independently developed, primarily for topical use, with frequent reports of efficacy. The following combinations are examples of how these combinations can be used:

Anti-Aging and Skin Tightening: A facial toner of 1 part DMSO and 9 parts isotonic seawater is applied after washing, followed by a vegetable oil or aloe vera moisturizer which hydrates and firms the skin. Alternatively, a spray of 10–15% DMSO with CBD oil and pansy tea is used for skin rejuvenation. Additionally, daisy tea, MSM, neem oil, malic acid and small amounts (e.g., 2%) of magnesium lactate, sodium gluconate and urea are also sometimes used for skin and facial care.

Cellulite, Wrinkles, and Scars:

3 parts DMSO, 2 parts 21% D-lactic acid, 5 parts 12% magnesium chloride (MgCl₂), applied as a spray for cellulite, stretch marks, or facial care. Reported to soften skin and reduce hypertrophic scars in 6–8 weeks when combined with vitamin C.

Substitute ascorbic acid (vitamin C) for lactic acid in the previous formula to address pigmentation disorders or scars.

2 parts DMSO, 2 parts 21% D-lactic acid, 3 parts urine, 3 parts 12% MgCl₂. plus 1 tsp hydroxyethylcellulose for cellulite and scars.

Pigmentation Disorders: A mixture of 3 parts DMSO, 1-2 part 21% D-lactic acid, and 5-6 parts 12% MgCl₂ or urine is applied topically to address facial pigmentation disorders. This formulation has proven effective, with DMSO alone occasionally sufficient for milder cases.

Eczema and Blemished Skin: A blend of isotonic seawater, 10% DMSO, 5% 21% D-lactic acid, and 3% urea enhances skin hydration and regeneration. For atopic dermatitis, a 1:1:1 mix of seawater, pansy tea, and urine with 5% DMSO is used.

Dry or Cracked Skin: Combine aloe gel and almond oil (10:1), 20% seawater, 5% DMSO, and 3–5% urea for hydration and healing.

Hair Loss and Scalp Health: MgCl₂ is often used to enhance DMSO hair restoration (e.g., with a spray of 10–15% DMSO diluted with 12% MgCl₂ is massaged into the scalp before washing or overnight). Additions like vitamin C, B12, sodium gluconate, rosemary oil or peppermint oils are occasionally included to enhance effects.
Note: thicker hair and reversed graying has been reported with DMSO, vitamin C, and L-lactic acid.

Creams and Gels: Many other ingredients are also used for creams (e.g., sesame oil, shea butter, beeswax, nettle hydrolate, Emulsan, Schüssler salts, propolis and lemon oil) or shower gels (e.g., seawater, baking soda, natural clays, almond oil, xanthan).

Note: hydroxyethylcellulose is often added to DMSO mixtures to thicken them into a gel. In many of these formulas, only 2-3% DMSO is used, in part because that’s all that’s needed to make them more effective, and in part because higher amounts can disrupt the hydroxyethylcellulose’s thickening.

Acne and Skin Lesions: A mix of 5% DMSO, 20% seawater, 3–5% urea, and aloe gel/almond oil (10:1) has addressed acne and neurodermitis. A gel with DMSO, lactic acid, urea, and seawater targets subsurface issues. Witch hazel is added for oily or acne-prone skin as a cleansing astringent.

Note: For sensitive skin, limit DMSO to 10% and avoid synthetic hair products. Cleanse skin prior to application to prevent penetration of unwanted substances.

Holistic Therapies
Many different holistic therapies bring about some of the therapeutic effects triggered by DMSO. In turn, many practitioners have found adding DMSO to their regimens both enhances the efficacy of their treatments and allows them to treat cases that are resistant to their current approach (e.g., they never responded or their improvement has peaked). Experiences in various modalities include:

•Acupuncture—When applied topically before or after acupuncture, practitioners report improved energy flow and pain relief, particularly for chronic conditions, and improved tissue repair and soreness following treatment. Typically, 30-60% DMSO (diluted with MgCl₂) is sprayed along the meridian pathways or acupuncture points to reduce inflammation and increase circulation.
Note: DMSO has also been observed to significantly enhance the efficacy of trigger point injections.

•Physical Therapy—Applying a 50–60% DMSO solution 15–20 minutes before physical therapy reduces muscle and joint stiffness, improving mobility and therapy effectiveness (including in chronic issues like frozen shoulders), with the effects sometimes being enhanced with heat.
Note: one interesting DMSO therapy I came across was to spray it (30% diluted with 12% MgCl₂ or seawater) on the spine then have the patient lie on their stomach on a wood floor and after 20 minutes, place a warm stone or wooden disc on their spine and lightly tap it with a mallet as the object is moved up the spine (which is used for back pain, internal organ stimulation, intestinal inflammation, polyneuropathy, and paralysis).

•Ultrasound Therapy—DMSO, often as a gel with hydroxypropyl cellulose, is applied before ultrasound therapy to enhance penetration of therapeutic agents, improving outcomes for pain and inflammation in musculoskeletal conditions.

•Osteopathy—Some osteopaths have reported DMSO (used as a 30-60% gel or an injection mixed with procaine or homeopathic remedies) 15 minutes before manual therapy significantly improves treatment of inflammatory joint issues, such as ankle or hip problems.

•Homeopathy—DMSO can be used to deliver low-potency homeopathic remedies through the skin without requiring injection and to amplify their effects. Rhus toxicodendron (for joint pain and mixed with 30% DMSO) is the most commonly cited combination.
Note: given how homeopathy is supposed to work (specific structures being stored in water), I find it surprising that the remedies still work once diluted in DMSO. As I’ve only seen reports stating they do (rather than do not), this suggests there is much more for me to understand here.

•Effective Microorganisms—this is a probiotic preparation within molasses composed of a variety of bacteria and yeasts with the environment (including some found in the gut) that break down a variety of organic matter in the environment. In gastrointestinal conditions, it is sometimes mixed with DMSO to improve gut health and digestion, or treat inflammatory bowel diseases and leaky gut (an area where DMSO is often quite effective).
Note: I had never heard of this formulation before seeing a few references to it being used with DMSO.

•Bee Venom—this somewhat uncomfortable remedy is sometimes used for certain chronic illnesses (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain). It becomes much more comfortable (and less itchy) when applied topically with up to 80% DMSO. Additionally, it has been observed that with DMSO, it treats varicose veins and spider veins (when applied to the origin of the vein).

•Red/Near Infrared Light Therapy—Combined with topical DMSO (30–60%), this therapy treats migraines, knee injuries, and autoimmune skin conditions. The synergy enhances pain and inflammation relief, with DMSO improving tissue penetration of light-based effects.
Note: a few people have shared with me that they are experimenting with using DMSO (or DMSO and water) to bring light into the body, but have not yet reached any conclusions.

•Hypnosis and Meditation—DMSO is applied to the hands or navel (a few drops of 30% DMSO) before hypnosis or meditation sessions to enhance relaxation and informational flow, possibly due to its effects on ion and water interactions or its treatment of one of the primary scars that often disrupts the nervous system. Practitioners report improved session effectiveness, with patients experiencing deeper focus and psychological stabilization, particularly in addiction clinics and breaking through psychotherapy resistant conditions.
Note: meditators and mind-body practitioners have also reported “spiritual breakthroughs” when using DMSO while practicing.

•Bioresonance and Magnetic Field Therapy—A 30% DMSO solution is applied topically before these therapies to enhance tissue conductivity and treatment efficacy. Users note improved responsiveness in conditions resistant to standard approaches.

•Cold Water Therapy—DMSO complements cold showers, a vascular therapy, by enhancing circulation. Applied topically (30–60%) before cold exposure, it supports treatment of circulatory disorders, amplifying DMSO’s vascular effects.

•Nutrient-Dense Raw Food Diets—DMSO is theorized to enhance nutrient absorption when added to water with a raw food diet, due to its solvent properties, although this likely is not ideal to do longterm (rather focus should be directed to gut health and the microbiome).

Conclusion
Given the almost infinite number of possible things that can be added to DMSO, this has been the hardest part of the series to write, and hence why I saved it for last.
Note: at this point all that’s left in the series is to revise the previous article with around 1000 more studies I’ve come across (along with coming through around 20,000 more search results and two remaining books), write focused articles on a few areas where DMSO excels (e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases, eye disorders and more herbology), sort and summarize the 3500 DMSO testimonials I’ve received, and then write a concise article summarizing everything about DMSO—which while a lot, is much less than what’s been done so far and it’s hence a huge relief to have finally passed this milestone.

Unfortunately, as you might have realized, this lengthy article only touched the surface of what is possible with the natural DMSO combinations, again illustrating just how much there is to learn. As such, it will only be learned through personal experimentation as each of us tries out combinations that have the potential to address our needs and then reports to the community what happened. Likewise, I strongly suspect some of the combinations I’ve identified are not actually needed, as DMSO alone would accomplish the same effect (so critical feedback is needed as well).
Note: many who’ve successfully experimented with natural DMSO combinations found their intuition and body awareness were very helpful for identifying helpful formulations.

Much of this article was made possible by the work of the German DMSO community, particularly Harmut Fischer (the author of the best DMSO book currently on the market, who also directs a DMSO focused natural medicine institute and personally teaches DMSO workshops). Fischer, in turn, has spent years combining his natural medicine and chemistry background to work with a community I would estimate (from all the posts I went through) is around 10,000 people. From that, he has made a wide range of discoveries which have advanced the discipline of DMSO, particularly since DMSO and its combination therapies are highly appealing to DIY (“do it yourself”) individuals with an interest in both natural medicine and taking control of their health.

Note: while I do not agree with everything Fischer has put forward (e.g., I caught and correted numerous errors in it), I believe he is the best and most accurate modern source of DMSO information (and whom many others have taken their material from—something that has recently happened to me as well the material here has reappeared in recently published DMSO books). However, as Fischer’s focus, like mine, is simply on advancing human growth and understanding, he is the only DMSO author whom I’ve found who explicitly gave permission for others to use his work, as he ultimately just wants this field to evolve.

Unfortunately, there are few major issues with Fischer's work. Except for his 2015 book, is in German, and as such, very few (even many seasoned DMSO researchers) are aware it exists, much of it is not optimally organized, and while he belongs to a relatively large DMSO community, it is still quite small.

My hope hence has been that by laying out all the existing material on DMSO in a clear and accessible manner, the much larger reach of this newsletter (e.g., there are 250,000 subscribers and far more outside readers) will be able to cultivate a community where readers can develop this science and find a myriad of DMSO uses and combinations which can benefit humanity. I strongly believe this is possible (e.g., we’ve already seen a lot of remarkable stories) and hence have tried to do all that I can to lay the foundation for this endeavor.

While DMSO cannot be the sole focus of this newsletter (as there are many other Forgotten Sides of Medicine) I will continue to do all that I can to cultivate this field (e.g., I’m hoping an educational group like Fischer’s comes together in America), and will be sure to share the experiences and discoveries each of you makes with the community here. The incredible (and almost unthinkable) changes we have accomplished since COVID were because of the remarkable community that came together, and you have my sincere gratitude not only for the support and voice you have given me, but also for the work each of you has done to broaden our understanding and accessibility of these forgotten therapies.

This series, and particularly this article, has been an incredible amount of work, and I deeply appreciate your support, which has made this all possible.

Lastly, if you have any experiences with natural DMSO combinations, please be sure to share them (e.g., in the comments below) so that I can ensure they are incorporated into the growing knowledge base for this field.
